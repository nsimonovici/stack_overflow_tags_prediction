"700011","1","700243","","2009-03-31 04:39:24","","0","277","<p>On every break on the Production/QA/Dev getting to the root of the exception is very crucial and time taking process.</p>

<p>As the web applications are in multi user environment and Stateless \ Asynchronous (HTTP) ,its really a tough job to look at the Eventviewer / log files and root cause an issue reported by the end user; Also it depends on how educated the End-user to explain the issue in detail. </p>

<p>I came up with a creative way to log the Exceptions. Which makes the job easier for the End user and Dev team?</p>

<p>We will follow a signature to log the Exceptions into an XML file, and which can be processed remotely for viewing or reports on Exceptions</p>

<p>The signature of the Static method in the Error logging class is as follows</p>

<p><em>WriteLog (Unique Number , Module Name, Priority, Layer ,String Custom Message,Exception with Stack Trace);</em> </p>

<p>I know there are many reusable Exception handling libraries, but what I was looking at is a unique number to track the issue that should get displayed to the end user</p>

<p>Response back to the User : </p>

<p>If the Exception is expected to handled and consumed then it’s up the developer to show the valid user-friendly message to the end user. Incase of any unexpected or exception is thrown to the Application layer ( Global .asax ) the Response would be cleared and Custom Message in HTML will be written back to the user with the Unique ID like the below one</p>

<p>“ An Unexpected Error has occurred , the Exception has be recorded for further action; Please use the # <em>Unique number generated</em>  to communicate the Support team “</p>

<p>Parameter Details :  </p>

<p>Unique Number : This is the unique number generated for every Exception,  a read only (get) property in the ErrorLogging Class which would be unique per exception , this would be concatenation of the <em>Hour+Minutes+Seconds+Milliseconds</em>;  initially I thought to use GUID but then it would be tough for the end user to remember the GUID to report the issue.  </p>

<p>Public string strExceptionID {</p>

<pre><code>      Get { 

      return  DateTime.Now.ToString(“HHmmssfff”);

          }    

     }
</code></pre>

<p>Module Name : This would be a Static Enum variable with Module Name
Ex : 
enum ModuleName { </p>

<pre><code>    Module1, 

    Module2, 

    Module3  };
</code></pre>

<p>Priority:   This would be a Static Enum variable with Priority , developer has to decide  the priority like if it’s a validation fail of Date or integer format use “Low” or if its unexpected in a Business layer call then use “2” .  </p>

<p>I think Priority High should be used in only in DAL or in Business Logic Layer or like if the interface to SAP or Ariba fails.
Ex : enum Priority { </p>

<pre><code>        High =1, 
      Medium =2, 
      Low =3, };
</code></pre>

<p>Layer :</p>

<p>This would be a Static Enum variable with Layer 
Ex : enum Layer { </p>

<pre><code>      Presentation, 
      Business, 
      DataAccess 
            };
</code></pre>

<p>String Custom Message :</p>

<p>This is optional parameter, and its upto the developer to supply an information to help explain the Reason or Empty string can be passed.</p>

<p>Exception with Stack Trace : This would the Exception object which would be further processed inside the method.</p>

<p>The processing done inside the error log method :</p>

<p>The method will  additionally get the logged-in Userid and timestamp and write it to the XML File. </p>

<p>Pros :</p>

<p>-> XML Logging will enable us to process an use it in any manner
-> The exceptions can be viewed remotely in a browser.
-> Easy to trace and find any exception.
-> We can search , sort exception based on Module, Priority , Time Stamp , UserID…etc
-> We can generate reports @ Module level , Layer wise , Priority , Time…</p>

<p>Cons :
         Dependency on the XML file, if its lost all the exceptions would go for a toss, we can overcome this in two ways; writing the xml to DB on timely basis OR write this on top of Event viewer logging as we'll always have the backup.</p>

<p>Based on the review comments I'll post the XML Schema and the ASPX page to view and search the errors.</p>

<p>Please take time to review and give ur feedback.</p>

The project manager (non technical) has given me an objective of improving productivity to 1 bug correction per man/day. This has been a real challenge, and I would like to know what other developers/managers may have done to improve bug correction rates.</p>

<p>Some factors that play a role in this situation:</p>

<ul>
<li>team is geographically distributed (Europe, Asia, Australia), 10-20 developers in each area</li>
<li>large code base that I am not all that familiar with as I have been with the company for only 9 months</li>
<li>only the least experienced developers are allocated to bug corrections, most capable developers are working on enhancements</li>
<li>we follow agile, so we use source control, continuous integration, bug database, project has schedule and specs for new work, we have testers and do usability testing</li>
<li>our code is dependent on many in house and third party components / libraries</li>
<li>program manager has some old bug correction metrics, showing 0.7 bug correction per man/day. My concern is that this was based on a team of experienced developers working on a prototype, correcting bugs in code that they themselves wrote. Now I am co-ordinating a team of developers that are not familiar with the code, and the bugs are originating from the validation team.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some more information after reading first few answers:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have tried to argue against using the bugs corrected productivity metric, didn't get too far with this approach</li>
<li>all bugs are prioritized (1-5), include a severity (1-5) and tagged with additional information (eg. BLOCKED by another bug, CRASH, NOT-REPRODUCIBLE, etc)</li>
<li>most bugs have a unit test case written when they are corrected</li>
<li>bugs in particular area of code are allocated to the people familiar with that area, if possible</li>
<li>bug correction rates are tracked on a per team basis, and correction history is kept</li>
<li>in daily stand ups I try to get people moving by asking for blocking issues and solving them</li>
<li>all new code is written with unit tests</li>
<li>yes, i have been doing my best to improve the productivity metric by various means - closing old non-relevant bugs, creating and correcting bugs for issues that would otherwise be solved without a bug report</li>
<li><p>i have developed python scripts that access the bug database directly to automate some mundane aspects of bug management and for report creation</p></li>

<p>The purpose is to prevent spam.  HTML is stripped so I need to detect invitations to copy-and-paste.  <em>It should not be economical for a spammer to post links because most users could not successfully get to the page</em>.  I would like suggestions, references, or discussion on best-practices.</p>

<p>Some objectives:</p>

<ul>
<li>The low-hanging fruit like well-formed URLs (<code>http://some-fqdn/some/valid/path.ext</code>)</li>
<li>URLs but without the <code>http://</code> prefix (i.e. a valid FQDN + valid HTTP path)</li>
<li>Any other funny business</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, I am blocking spam, but the same process could be used to auto-link text.</p>

<h2>Ideas</h2>

<p>Here are some things I'm thinking.</p>

<ul>
<li>The content is native-language prose so I can be trigger-happy in detection</li>
<li>Should I strip out all whitespace first, to catch ""<code>www .example.com</code>""? Would common users know to remove the space themselves, or do any browsers ""do-what-I-mean"" and strip it for you?</li>
<li>Maybe multiple passes is a better strategy, with scans for:

<ul>
<li>Well-formed URLs</li>
<li>All non-whitespace followed by '.' followed by any valid TLD</li>
<li>Anything else?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Related Questions</h2>

<p>I've read these and they are now documented here, so you can just references the regexes in those questions if you want.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37684/replace-url-with-html-links-javascript"">replace URL with HTML Links javascript</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/161738/what-is-the-best-regular-expression-to-check-if-a-string-is-a-valid-url"">What is the best regular expression to check if a string is a valid URL</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27745/getting-parts-of-a-url-regex"">Getting parts of a URL (Regex)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Update and Summary</h2>

<p>Wow, I there are some very good heuristics listed in here! For me, the best bang-for-the-buck is a synthesis of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>@Jon Bright's technique of detecting TLDs (a good defensive chokepoint)</li>
<li>For those suspicious strings, replace the dot with a dot-looking character as per @capar</li>
<li>A good dot-looking character is @Sharkey's subscripted &amp;middot; (i.e. ""<sub>&middot;</sub>"").  &amp;middot; is also a word boundary so it's harder to casually copy &amp; paste.</li>
</ol>

<p>That should make a spammer's CPM low enough for my needs; the ""flag as inappropriate"" user feedback should catch anything else. Other solutions listed are also very useful:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strip out all dotted-quads (@Sharkey's comment to his own answer)</li>
<li>@Sporkmonger's requirement for client-side Javascript which inserts a required hidden field into the form.</li>
<li>Pinging the URL server-side to establish whether it is a web site.  (Perhaps I could run the HTML through SpamAssassin or another Bayesian filter as per @Nathan..)</li>
<li>Looking at Chrome's source for its smart address bar to see what clever tricks Google uses</li>
<li>Calling out to OWASP AntiSAMY or other web services for spam/malware detection.</li>

All it has is a text header and a simple vector graphic border.</p>

<p>I have no problem at all using this code to instantiate a FLVPlayback object dynamically - or creating an instance on the timeline. In either case the movie size increases to about 50kb because of the video player definition.</p>

When a user puts in their name and hits next I want the calendar control to become selecatable for a start date.  I have the ability to mark the start date as green.  I want them to select away until they hit the continue button.  Issue 1 is they can hit next without a date.  I want to catch that.  Issue two is they can reselect many times before hitting next.  I want them to be able to do that.  Once they hit next I want them to be able to chose and end date over and over until they hit next.  Then I want them to confirm their coices.  I guess the logic isn't so simple ... The code I wrote is so bad.  :(.  Even the proper fixes hurt my head because StartDateStartPart and EndDateStartPart just would become mental gibberish.

Particularly, I'd like to be able to show the letters of the alphabet down the side so that as you scroll through the list, you see your position in the alphabet in the scrollbar. The problem is that my data basically consists of key-value pairs, not contact data, so I can't easily use the native contact picker.</p>

<p>As far as I can see, I have two options to achieve what I want:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use the ABPeoplePickerNavigationController class and hack it to use an address book which I fill myself with non-address type data. The problem with this is that, by default, the address book will fill up with the contacts from the iPhone so that each time the app opened, I'd have to flush those contacts and build my own list. (Not to mention other problems associated with using an interface which is bound to a particular data structure)</li>
<li>Use a UISearchBar and UIScrollView. This would be fine, but I'm not sure how to do anything to the scroll bar except change its colour - I can't see how to override its contents.</li>

It does this by first building the script, then executing it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>vsdbcmd.exe /a:Deploy /cs:""Data Source=(local);Integrated Security=True;Pooling=False"" /dsp:Sql /dd /model:""..\Database.dbschema"" /p:TargetDatabase=TargetDB /manifest:""..\Database.deploymanifest""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would expect that it can deploy the script to a different database server without problems. However, the complete path to the actual .mdf file is encoded in the script, along with some other references to the original databse. Either there isn't an option to control this, or I can't find it.</p>

<p>Is anyone using this? How do you deploy? Should I have used a different kind of database project (I remember having the choice way back when between ""Database project"" and ""Server project"", but I don't know whether that matters)?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I can override the .sqlcmdvars just fine, but this does not solve the problem. This is an extract from the generated .sql file using a command like above:</p>

<pre><code>GO
:setvar DatabaseName ""TargetDB""
:setvar DefaultDataPath ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\""
</code></pre>

<p>So there is the ""targetdb"" target database gets recorded correctly. But, a few lines further:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE DATABASE [$(DatabaseName)]
ON 
PRIMARY(NAME = [Original], FILENAME = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\Original.mdf', SIZE = 3072 KB, MAXSIZE = UNLIMITED, FILEGROWTH = 1024 KB)

</code></pre>

<p>where Original.mdf is the name of the original database (i.e. the db where we deploy during development, and that is set in the project properties of the database project). This is where the deployment fails, either because that exact path may be different on the target machine, or on my machine because that db already exists.</p>

<p>These values just seem hardcoded in the generated script.</p>

<p>The reader is a USB device, but unfortunately integrated so tightly into this screen/computer that I cannot detach it and connect it to something else.</p>

<p>To boot, the SDK is a pain, since it is non-existant. The SDK consists of a VB (not .NET) application which communicates with the USB device through the HID subsystem through a handful of windows api functions, and since we need this to be part of a .NET application we need to reimplement it using P/Invoke.</p>

<p>Thus, testing this will be a pain since I will probably have to continously copy new files onto the machine and have a ton of logging to figure out what goes wrong.</p>

<p>Or do I? What else can I do? Running Visual Studio on that machine will be a bigger pain than just copying the program and using logging so that's not an option, but what else? Can I remote debug this from my own machine? The machine has networking capabilities so I can reach it over the network just fine.</p>

<p>Any tips or advice anyone can give?</p>

Now we started out with the namespace based configuration, e.g. a spring-security.xml file with stuff like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;http auto-config=""true""&gt;
    &lt;intercept-url...&gt;
    ...
&lt;/http&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But you have to go with form-based as default or http-basic as default (i.e. this only configures one filter chain). What I want is for some stuff to never redirect to a form and just use http-basic or equivalent. The manual does seem to <a href=""http://static.springframework.org/spring-security/site/reference/html/supporting-infrastructure.html#filters"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cover this</a>, only if you follow their advice, you'll end up having to define own filter chains for everything.</p>

<p>So I was wondering, is there really no other way? Is there perhaps a way I can reuse the filter chain introduced by the http element for those elements that can still use the old scheme? The namespace based config is really handy for us since it's easy to read and understandable, whereas a list of bean definitions is  less so...</p>

<p>I have a partial view that is used in several places across my ASP.NET MVC application. The partial view contains a list of ""objects"" to select, i.e. something similar to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;%
        foreach (var person in Model.Persons)
        {
    %&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" class=""person""&gt;

    &lt;%
        }        
    %&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Each person has a unique id. </p>

<p>I use jQuery for my AJAXy stuff, and up until now I have added click functionality to the links in the following way (although it has a very non-jQuery-like smell)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#"" class=""person"" onclick=""return selectPerson('&lt;%= person.Id %&gt;');""&gt;
            &lt;%= person.Name %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It works and all, however it also requires me to have a selectPerson() javascript function on each page using this partial view (since what happens in the select is ""special"" for each view).</p>

<p>I just stumbled upon the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Core/data"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jQuery Data()</a> method and it seems to be able to support my needs, i.e. in the views using my partial person list view I could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>$(""a.person"").click(function() { alert($(this).data(""personId"")); return false; });
</code></pre>

<p>If I have the Id's attached to the ""personId"" data property on the DOM elements.</p>

<p>Now the problem I have is that I do the HTML rendering server side, but the attaching of the ""personId"" data property to the DOM elements must be done client side. I.e. either during the foreach loop or in a separate JS loop but I would prefer to avoid that.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm going down the wrong path, I dunno, but maybe somebody has a solution for this or maybe a better approach?</p>

<p>I've got all the pieces below:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>main page</strong> (loads everything)</li>
<li><strong>View</strong> (XAML file with bindings)</li>
<li><strong>Model</strong> (a Customer class generating a fake List collection)</li>
<li><strong>ModelView</strong> (inherits INotifyPropertyChanged and has the PropertyChanged for the two fields that View needs)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>create the <strong>ViewModel</strong> </li>
<li>bind the <strong>ViewModel</strong> to the <strong>DataContext</strong> of the <strong>View</strong></li>
<li>create the <strong>Model</strong> (customers)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>But now how do I connect the ModelView to the Model?</strong> I feel as though I need to inject my customers Model somehow into the CustomerViewModel, is that right? But how exactly? What is the next step here to finish this MVVM example so that I can start using the advantages of the MVVM pattern, e.g. swapping out the model with a test model, swapping out the view with new views, etc. </p>

<p>At work we had a discussion about whether or not to allow goto in our coding standard. In general nobody wanted to allow free usage of goto but some were positive about using it for cleanup jumps. As in this code:</p>

<pre><code>void func()
{
   char* p1 = malloc(16);
   if( !p1 )
      goto cleanup;

   char* p2 = malloc(16);
   if( !p2 )
      goto cleanup;

 goto norm_cleanup;

 err_cleanup:

   if( p1 )
      free(p1);

   if( p2 )
      free(p2);

 norm_cleanup:
}
</code></pre>

<p>The abovious benefit of such use is that you don't have to end up with this code:</p>

<pre><code>void func()
{
   char* p1 = malloc(16);
   if( !p1 ){
      return;
   }

   char* p2 = malloc(16);
   if( !p2 ){
      free(p1);
      return;
   }

   char* p3 = malloc(16);
   if( !p3 ){
      free(p1);
      free(p2);
      return;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Especially in constructor-like functions with many allocations this can sometimes grow very bad, not the least when someone has to insert something in the middle.</p>

<p>So, in order to be able to use goto, but still clearly isolate it from being used freely, a set of flow controlling macros was created for handling the task. Looks something like this (simplified):</p>

<pre><code>#define FAIL_SECTION_BEGIN int exit_code[GUID] = 0;
#define FAIL_SECTION_DO_EXIT_IF( cond, exitcode ) if(cond){exit_code[GUID] = exitcode; goto exit_label[GUID];}
#define FAIL_SECTION_ERROR_EXIT(code) exit_label[GUID]: if(exit_code[GUID]) int code = exit_code[GUID];else goto end_label[GUID]
#define FAIL_SECTION_END end_label[GUID]:
</code></pre>

<p>We can use this as follows:</p>

<pre><code>int func()
{
   char* p1 = NULL;
   char* p2 = NULL;
   char* p3 = NULL;

   FAIL_SECTION_BEGIN

<p>It looks nice, and comes with many benefits, BUT, are there any drawbacks we should be thinking about before rolling this out into development? It is after all very flow controlling and goto:ish. Both are discouraged. What are the arguments for discouraging them in this case?</p>

<p>Yes, it is difficult to get people to program using templates.

<li>_OnInit is not possible because the 'Inner table' for the Gridview is added after Init</li>
<li>_OnLoad is not possible because the 'selected' row is not selected yet.</li>

<p>The format of the csv-file is not so nice: you need a column for each variable. I would expect a row for each variable. </p>

<p>It works with Umlaut (ä, ö etc)</p>

<p>EDIT 1:</p>

<p>Another solution is to use com to automate Photoshop. Thats nice if you have a couple of templates (buttons) that need changed text. Here is my script in python that might get you startet.</p>

<p>You need to have an excel file with columns:
TemplateFileName,   TargetFileName, TargetFormat, Text
(ie template.psd, button1 , gif , NiceButton) .
The first row of the sheet is not used.
The psp template should only have 1 textlayer and can not have layergroups.</p>

<p>This is what happens:  When The page first loads, the hidden field is undefined, which it should be.  When I click on a row and then click the 'select' button which then calls this:</p>

<pre><code>GridView.Attributes.Add(""disabled"", ""true"");
</code></pre>

<p>The gridview becomes disabled (along with the select button) and another gridview comes up (which should happen depending on what is seleted in the first gridview).  So now, here is the problem.  When I click on a row in the gridview (I'm only talking about the initial gridview, not the secondary one which comes up, that's not an issue here), and click select, everything gets greyed out and most of the time, the selected row will highlight when the page loads (the other times for some reason it defaults to row #2).  Then, say you click on row 4 then click on row 1 and then click select, for some reason row 4 will remain highlighted and row 4's data will then populate the second gridview, like you never clicked row 1.  But if I click row 4 then click row 1 then click row 1 again, does it save.  Does anyone know why that happens?</p>

<p>Also, I'm pretty much trying to disable the first gridview when select is hit so I do </p>

<pre><code>GridView.Attributes.Add(""disabled"", ""true"");
</code></pre>

<p>rather than 
    GridView.Enabled = false;</p>

<p>If a user re-clicks the search button (another button located previously on the page which makes this gridview become visible), I would like the secondary gridview to become hidden, and the primary gridview (this one in question) to become re-enabled.  But doing </p>

<pre><code>GridView.Attributes.Add(""disabled"", ""false"");
</code></pre>

<p>when the search button is fired only disables the gridview, which is very weird.  Now I know that the disabled field is not supported by any other browser except IE, and i only use it because I need to check if the gridview is disabled so a user cant click on another row after they've made their selection (which happens if I dont do the following:</p>

<pre><code>if (document.getElementById(gridViewCtlId).disabled == false)
</code></pre>

<p>So could anyone let me know of another way of accomplishing that task?  Thanks again in advance.</p>

<p>It's a serious question though, as I'm on an internal applications dev team that manages the apps on a couple dozen servers. The networking folks typically don't care what we call the servers as long as they know about 'em, so we can come up with whatever conventions.</p>

<p>The apps the servers deal with can be home-grown custom apps, or they can be larger vendor ones like SharePoint. They can be:</p>

<ul>
<li>In multiple networking environments that can't speak to each other (think firewalled-off external servers versus intranet-esque servers)</li>
<li>In different physical locations (California office versus New York, etc.)</li>
<li>In multiple deployment tiers (production, staging, testing, dev)</li>
<li>Have one or many functions (web server, DB server, mail server, app server)</li>
<li>Load-balanced or not</li>
<li>Standby (for disaster recovery purposes) or primary</li>
</ul>

<p>Whew! Think it's even possible to come up with a convention that can address all of these aspects, or significant ones? It'd be nice to hear a server name (or DNS entry for it) and be able to immediately know what it does, and it works for getting new guys up to speed as well. ""sharepoint-IPC-1 is down"" could be parsed into ""the internal production SharePoint web server in the California datacenter that's the first node in the load balancing is down!""...but that seems overly complicated at first glance.</p>

<p>Another thing in the back of my mind is that an old mail relay server is getting decommissioned, which means we have to scour through a lot of old apps to repoint hardcoded server values (I know... :).</p>

<p>I have 'mastered' pulling data from a database, through a service and into a datagrid and also populating image elements in the rows. So far so good.</p>

<p>Now i'm stuck and have a headache!</p>

<p>I want to add a simple animation (a green rectangle moving over a red rectangle to display a % progress) to the last column of each row, but can't get it wired up.</p>

<p>My xaml looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;data:DataGrid.Columns&gt;

&lt;/data:DataGrid.Columns&gt;

<p>which is quite obviously wrong (because it doesn't work) and I am starting to think that it just is not possible to add animation to a Datagrid in this way. I've Googled hard looking for a piece of code and while there have been some tantilising results they have not amounted to anything.</p>

<p>Am I trying to do something that Silverlight simply does not support or am I missing something really straightforward?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
Although I'm not out of the woods yet I have managed to get the animation running with the appropriate column.
The answer provided by MasterMax led me to look at EventTriggers and the revised xaml looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;data:DataGridTemplateColumn&gt;
    &lt;data:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;
        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
            &lt;Rectangle x:Name=""GoalProgress"" Height=""100"" Width=""1"" Fill=""Green""&gt;
                &lt;Rectangle.Triggers&gt;
                    &lt;EventTrigger RoutedEvent=""Rectangle.Loaded""&gt;

with the source repository because it already contains all the

that's not much help since then I can't access the source

<p>Why can't <strong>enums</strong> be declared local like <strong>classes</strong>?</p>

<p>I found this very useful in certain situations. In the case I was working, the rest of the code didn't need to know anything about the <code>enum</code>.</p>

<p>Is there any <em>structural/design</em> conflict that explains why this is not possible or could this be a <em>future</em> feature of Java?</p>

<p>I'm not looking for specific answers to each, but here's an idea of what I'm trying to get an idea of.</p>

<ul>
<li>For server-based apps, do you ensure monitoring is in place? To what degree...just that it responds to ping, that it can hit all of its dependencies at any given moment, that the logic that the app actually services is sound (e.g., a service that calculates 2+2 actually returns ""4"")</li>
<li>Do you require automated build scripts before code is released? Meaning, any dev can walk onto a new box, yank something from source control, and start developing? Given things like an OS and IDE, of course.</li>
<li>How about automated deployment scripts, for server-based apps?</li>
<li>What level of documentation do you require for a project to be ""done?""</li>
<li>Do you make dang sure you have a full-fledged backup plan for all of the major components of the system, if it's server-based?</li>
<li>Do you enforce code quality standards? Think StyleCop for .NET or cyclomatic complexity evaluations.</li>
<li>Unit testing? Integration tests? Performance load testing?</li>
<li>Do you have standards for how your application's error logging is handled? How about error notification?</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, not looking for a line-by-line punchlist of answers to anything above, necessarily. In short, <strong>what non-coding items must a code release have completed before it's officially considered ""done"" for your team?</strong></p>

Initially, I had this onmouseover/onmouseout thing working but for some reason, yesterday morning it failed to work, and all day yesterday, I have been struggling, googling for answers and coming up short.  Here is the databound function:</p>

<pre><code>protected void GridView_OnRowCreated(object sender, GridViewRowEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.Row.RowType == DataControlRowType.DataRow)
        {
            e.Row.Attributes.Add(""onclick"", ""onGridViewRowSelected('"" + j.ToString() + ""')"");
            e.Row.Attributes.Add(""onmouseover"", ""HighlightOn(this)"");
            e.Row.Attributes.Add(""onmouseout"", ""HighlightOff(this)""); 
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the onmouseover and onmouse out functions:</p>

<pre><code>function HighlightOn(rowid)
{   
    if (document.getElementById(gridViewCtlId).disabled == false)
    {
        if ($(selectedIndex).val() != rowid.rowIndex)
        {
            rowid.style.backgroundColor = '#8FBAEF';
        }
    }
}

function HighlightOff(rowid)
{
    if (document.getElementById(gridViewCtlId).disabled == false)
    {   
        if ($(selectedIndex).val() != rowid.rowIndex)
        {
            var modIdx = rowid.rowIndex % 2;
            if (modIdx == 0)
            {
                rowid.style.backgroundColor = 'Silver';
            }
            else
            {
                rowid.style.backgroundColor = 'White';
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>selectedIndex is being set by this:</p>

<pre><code>function getSelectedRow(rowIdx)
{
    getGridViewControl(rowIdx);
    if (gridViewCtl != null)
    {
        $(selectedIndex).val(rowIdx);
        return gridViewCtl.rows[rowIdx];
    }
    return null;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This function just gets the row by giving it the id of the row in a gridview (used for the onclick event to change the color of the row).</p>

<p>The problem is this:  When I click on a row, it becomes highlighted.  When I then move the mouse, the other rows become somewhat highlighted, which is correct, but when I click on another row, and move the mouse out of that row, it becomes de-highlighted. And when i click on it again, does it stay highlighted.  selectedIndex is just a hidden field on the page.  Does anyone see why this doesn't function properly?  Thanks.</p>

<p>The reason we're using an IFrame is to alow us to host the PDF in a page that also runs some scripts and has some more controls on (if a certain condition is met, we pop up a modal dialog using the modal dialog extender ,but we've switched that behaviour off and the problem is still occuring).  Not using an IFrame isn't a doable solution either.  I've checked the security settings in IE and they're all set to allow IFrames to be dislayed.</p>

<p>Here's the problem then - on some testers PCs the page displays the pdf fine.  On others we just get a blank page.</p>

<p>Just seen a machine that wasn't displaying start displaying when it was upgraded to IE7.  This unfortunately is not a solution as we have to support anything down to IE5.5 :(</p>

<p>I'd be super grateful for any ideas anybody has.</p>

<p>I should also mention that these machines have no trouble when navigating to a page similar to DocContent directly (rather than being hosted in an IFrame).</p>

<p>Imagine - if you will - a 3D engine that models not just the physical appearance of items, but also their audio properties.

I use Apache ant to make automatic builds via Continuous Integration.</p>

<p>My problems comes from the following situation: I don't want to fill to much files into the project-basedir, so the checkstyle.xml and the suppressions.xml are both in a subdirectory named conf (for configuration for build). Now Ant and Eclipse work differently for finding the suppressions.xml.</p>

<p>Ant use the project-basedir as basedir for finding the suppressions.xml, after I declared an ant-task to find the checkstyle.xml with the base-configuration of checkstyle. This checkstyle.xml now contains the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;module name=""SuppressionFilter""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""file"" value=""conf/suppressions.xml""/&gt;
&lt;/module&gt;

<p>This way the ant-build finds the suppressions.xml, because the basedir of the build is the project-directory.</p>

<p>Now using the <a href=""http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">checkstyle-plugin</a> for Eclipse brings a problem. It looks for the suppressions.xml starting with the path the checkstyle.xml has (conf). For Eclipse the declaration had to look like this, to work:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;module name=""SuppressionFilter""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""file"" value=""suppressions.xml""/&gt;
&lt;/module&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Even that doesn't work, Eclipse seems to need always an absolute path.</p>

<p>I want to know a way, that both Eclipse and Ant can work with the same checkstyle-configuration. Someone knows a solution to this problem? Absolute paths are no solution, because every developer and the CI-Server have different paths for the project-directory.</p>

The UserControls are actually nested, so I wanted to somehow signal to each UC that it should save itself, instead of somehow wrapping everything into one event or having a single event trigger a cascade of save events.</p>

<p>My plan was to use a static class (props to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/407902/set-global-variable-for-duration-of-a-request/407954#407954"">this answer</a> for the code):</p>

    public static bool FormIsSaving
    {
        get
        {
            object o = HttpContext.Current.Items[save_key];
            return Convert.ToBoolean(o);
        }
        set
        {
            HttpContext.Current.Items[save_key] = value;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally a button on my MasterPage would set RequestScopedFormData.FormIsSaving = true, and as .NET builds the Page and its UserControls, they would know to perform a save on themselves.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that I can't get an event to fire early enough in the Page lifecycle to save the UserControls.  Even if I move the saving code to the PreRender event, and I move the save ImageButton to the Page itself (instead of the MasterPage), I cannot get the FormIsSaving set to true before the UC saving check.</p>

<p>It happens something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Page Page_Load</li>
<li>MasterPage Page_Load</li>
<li>UC Page_Loads and PreRenders (they
are mixed, it prerenders some before
it loads others)</li>
<li>MasterPage SaveButton_Click event 
(this is where I set my class
variable)</li>
<li>MasterPage PreRender</li>
<li>Page PreRender</li>

<p>So unfortunately the SaveButton_Click method happens AFTER the UCs are loaded, so they never save.</p>

"701052","1","701102","","2009-03-31 13:48:53","","3","244","<p>I have a repository data access pattern like so:</p>

<pre><code>IRepository&lt;T&gt;
{
  .. query members ..
  void Add(T item);
  void Remove(T item);
  void SaveChanges();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Imagine the scenario where I have a repository of users, users have a user name which is unique, if I create a new user with a username that exists (imagine I have a dumb ui layer that doesn't check), when I add it to the repository, all is fine.. when I hit SaveChanges, my repository attempts to save the item to the database, my database is enforcing these rules luckily and throws me back an aborted exception due to a unique key violation.</p>

<p>It seems to me that, generally this validation is done at the layer ABOVE the repository, the layers that call it know they should ensure this rule, and will pre-check and execute (hopefully in some kind of transaction scope to avoid races, but doesn't always seem possible with the medium ignorance that exists).</p>

<p>Shouldn't my repository be enforcing these rules? what happens if my medium is dumb, such as a flat database without any integrity checks?</p>

<p>And if the repository is validating these kind of things, how would they inform callers about the violation in a way that the caller can accurately identify what went wrong, exceptions seem like a poor way to handle this because their relatively expensive and are hard to specialize down to a specific violation..</p>

<p>I've been playing around with a 'Can' pattern, for example.. CanAdd with Add, add will call CanAdd and throw an invalid operation exception if can returns a violation.. CanAdd also returns a list of violations about what went wrong.. this way I can start to stack these routines through the stack.. for example, the service layer above would also have a 'Can' method that would return the repositories report + any additional violations it wanted to check (such as more complicated business rules, such as which users can invoke specific actions).</p>

<p>Validation of data is such a fundamental yet I feel there is no real guidance for how to handle more advanced validation requirements reliably.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit, additionally in this case, how do you handle validation of entities that are in the repository and are updated via change tracking.. for example:</p>

<pre><code>using (var repo = ...)
{
  var user = repo.GetUser('user_b');
  user.Username = 'user_a';

  repo.SaveChanges(); // boom!
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you could imagine, this will cause an exception.. going deeper down the rabbit hole, imagine I've got a validation system in place when I add the user, and I do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>using (var repo = ...)
{
  var newUser = new User('user_c');
  repo.Add(newUser); // so far so good.

  var otherUser = repo.GetUser('user_b');
  otherUser.Username = 'user_c';

  repo.SaveChanges(); // boom!
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, validating when adding the user was pointless, as 'downstream' actions could screw us up anyway, the add validation rule would need to check the actual persistence storage AND any items queued up to persist.</p>

<p>This still doesn't stop the previous change tracking problem.. so now do I start to validate the save changes call? it seems like there would be a huge amount of violations that could happen from aparently unrelated actions.</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm asking for an unrealistic, perfect safety net?</p>

Stephen.</p>

Each record in the file represents a different entity; the record contains multiple sub-types.

I've created a class structure (a DATA DIVISION if you will) to hold the input data.</p>

<p>My question is, what best practices have you found for processing large, complex fixed-width files in .NET? My general approach will be to read the entire line into a string and then parse the data from the string into the classes I've created. But I'm not sure whether I'll get better results working with the characters in the string as an array, or with the string itself. I guess that's the specific question, string vs. char[], but I would appreciate any other pointers anyone has.</p>

<p>I know I'm doing something wrong - but can't figure out a better way.
I am developing a website which is going to allow users to setup their own mini-websites.</p>

<p>Something like Ning.
Also, I have only 1 basic login and access to each mini website is provided (right now) via roles.</p>

<p>So the way I am doing this right now is:</p>

<p>Everytime a new mini website is created - say blah, I create 2 roles in my application.
<strong>blah_users</strong> and <strong>blah_admin</strong></p>

<p>The user creating the mini website is given the role - blah_admin and every other user wanting to join this mini website (or network) is given the role - blah_user.</p>

<p>Anyone can view data from any website. However to add data, one must be a member of that mini site (must have the blah_user role assigned)</p>

<p>The problem that I am facing is that by doing a role based system, I'm having to do loads of stuff manually. Asp.Net 2 controls which work on the User.IsAunthenticated property are basically useless to me now because along with the IsAuthenticated property, I must also check if the user has the proper role.</p>

<p>I'm guessing there is a better way to architect the system but I am not sure how.
Any ideas?</p>

<p>This website is being developed in ASP.Net 2 on IIS 6.
Thanks a tonne!</p>

It used to use a delegate but I did a lot of recoding and ended up with a bitfield <code>&amp;</code> operation to avoid the delegate while still being able to perform matching within reason.  Basically, the challenge is to find all contiguous elements within a grid which match the <code>match</code> bitfield, starting from a specific ""leader"" square.
Square is somewhat small (but not tiny) class.  Any tips on how to push this to be even faster? Note that the grid itself is pretty small (500 elements in this test).</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It's worth noting that this function is called over 200,000 times per second.  In truth, in the long run my goal will be to call it less often, but that's really tough, considering that my end goal is to make the grouping system be handled with scripts rather than being hardcoded.  That said, this function is always going to be called more than any other function.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To clarify, the function does not check if <code>leader</code> matches the bitfield, by design.  The intention is that the leader is not required to match the bitfield (though in some cases it will).</p>

<p><strong>Things tried unsuccessfully:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Initializing the dictionary and stack with a capacity.</li>
<li>Casting the int to an enum to avoid a cast.</li>
<li>Moving the dictionary and stack outside the function and clearing them each time they are needed.  This makes things slower!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Things tried successfully:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Writing a hashcode function instead of using the default: Hashcodes are precomputed and are equal to <code>x + y * parent.Width</code>.  Thanks for the reminder, Jim Mischel.</li>
<li>mquander's Technique: See <code>GetGroupMquander</code> below.</li>
<li><p>Further Optimization: Once I switched to HashSets, I got rid of the <code>Contains</code> test and replaced it with an <code>Add</code> test.  Both <code>Contains</code> and <code>Add</code> are forced to seek a key, so just checking if an add succeeds is more efficient than adding if a <code>Contains</code> fails check fails.  That is, <code>if (RetVal.Add(s)) curStack.Push(s);</code></p>

This basically allows me to write a query where I link a record from a to b, and link the b record to a record from c. So far so good, simple query.</p>

<p>What my problem is... one of the columns included in the query (let's call it C.col3) has to have unique values; the values in this column can only show up once in the query result, but other columns from the other tables do not have this requirement.</p>

<p>Can anybody help me write this query?</p>

<p>Thanks...</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong></p>

<p>Here is the table layout (sorry, I have to use generic names)</p>

<p><strong>Table A</strong><br>
aID, bID, aCol1, aCol2, aCol3 ... aCol10</p>

<p><strong>Table B</strong><br>
bID, cID, bCol1, bCol2, bCol3 ... bCol10</p>

<p><strong>Table C</strong><br>
cID, cCol1, cCol2, <strong><em>col3</em></strong>, cCol4 ... cCol10</p>

<p>Without the unique value constraint in col3, I would write the query like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    A.aID, A.bID, A.aCol1 ... A.aCol10,
    B.bID, B.cID, B.bCol1 ... B.bCol10,
    C.cID, C.cCol1, C.cCol2, C.col3 ... C.cCol10
FROM
    A, B, C
WHERE 
    A.bID = B.bID AND B.cID = C.cID
</code></pre>

<p>... but of course that doesn't make sure the that values in C.col3 are unique.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong>
More info... <br>
Table A and Table B have a one to many relationship; A is the ""header"", B is the ""item"".<br>
Table B and Table C have a one to one relationship.<br><br>
These tables are part of a caching mechanism, so lots of data that looks similar, but is still different in some cols.<br><br>
Since A is the header, most of the duplicate values will be found in A.<br><br>
I first need to order the rows by A.aID, but then after that I only need the first rows returned, where the value for C.col3 does not appear in a previous row for that col.<br><br>
Does that make things a little clearer, or am I still not making any sense? :)
<br><br>
<strong>Final Update:</strong><br><br>
I chose Bartosz Klimek's answer as it was the closest to what I needed; I just had to modify the nested join clause in the middle.<br><br>
Thank you all for your help!</p>

Here are a few of the reasons parsing XML and HTML is hard:</p>

<p>People want to treat a file as a sequence of lines, but this is valid:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tag

<p>People want to treat &lt; or &lt;tag as the start of a tag, but stuff like this exists in the wild:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""imgtag.gif"" alt=""&lt;img&gt;"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>People often want to match starting tags to ending tags, but XML and HTML allow tags to contain themselves (which traditional regexes cannot handle at all):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span id=""outer""&gt;&lt;span id=""inner""&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>People often want to match against the content of a document (such as the famous ""find all phone numbers on a given page"" problem), but the data may be marked up (even if it appears to be normal when viewed):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class=""phonenum""&gt;(&lt;span class=""area code""&gt;703&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class=""prefix""&gt;348&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=""linenum""&gt;3020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  <p><strong>Satisficing</strong> (a portmanteau of ""satisfy"" and ""suffice"") is a decision-making strategy which attempts to meet criteria for adequacy, rather than to identify an optimal solution. A satisficing strategy may often be (near) optimal if the costs of the decision-making process itself, such as the cost of obtaining complete information, are considered in the outcome calculus. <em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Source)</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most decisions in software engineering are easy enough to take without pondering for hours on the subject. The first solution that comes to mind is usually good enough, so we can quickly use that and proceed to the next decision.</p>

<p>However, there are also those rare cases where you have to solve a more difficult and / or critical problem. Those problems can cost you a lot of money or time when solved in a suboptimal way.</p>

<p>In those cases I am usually trying to come up with several completely different solutions/approaches of solving the problem. I then pick one and refine it until I am fully satisfied with my solution.</p>

<p>Usually this works, but sometimes I can only come up with one adequate, but not really good, solution. I am aware that my solution is not very good and the problem is critical enough to warrant some more effort. However, knowledge of the solution I already found blocks my creativity, so I just can't find a second one (at least not right away). I am stuck with my mediocre idea and, unless I can ask someone else, I have to implement it to move forward.</p>

<p>Are there techniques to overcome this? The two things I can think of is holding a brainstorming session with someone else or going for a walk.</p>

<p>What do you do in those cases?</p>

<p>Presentation layer --> Business Layer --> Persistence layer. So for example, my presentation layer would call BusinessLayer.GetCustomer(id). In that method I would check that the caller has the right to fetch the customer. OK, that still works just fine with NHibernate. My question though is how do I have any security on Updates, Adding, and Deletes? For example, Suppose I want to modify the customer I got back. Normally, I would have done this: </p>

<pre><code>customer.FirstName =""Mike"";
BusinessLayer.UpdateCustomer(customer);
</code></pre>

<p>Again, the UpdateCustomer method would check that you can update this customer. OK, but with NHibernate, to update the customer I'm simply going to set the FirstName. I then don't NEED to call Update since it's all transparent. That's the point of Hibernate right: ""Transparent and Automated Persistence."" So how do I have my security checks in place with this transparency? I simply don't trust myself enough to not make a mistake and do something like:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;string&gt; customerNames = new List&lt;string&gt;();
foreach (Customer c in GetCustomersThatLikeStuffThatILike()) {
   string custName="""";
   c.CustomerName = custname; //Oops. I meant to say: custname = c.CustomerName;
   customerNames.Add(custName);  
}
</code></pre>

<p>Oops. I just wiped out all the customers' names in the database. Is this contrived? Yes. Now, if I had some sort of BusinessLayer check in place, this would just throw an exception because that user can't update other users' names. </p>

<p>Another issue. Suppose I'm an admin and can really do anything in the system and I have code like this:</p>

<pre><code>//Display a customers orders that haven't shipped yet:
var Orders = Customer.Orders;
Orders.RemoveAll(order =&gt; order.HasNotShipped);
Grid.DataSource = Orders;
Grid.DataBind();
</code></pre>

<p>OK, so here I just wanted to filter the orders, but I accidentally ended up deleting them from the database. The transparency caused me to do something very bad. How does one mitigate that risk?</p>

<p>I really <em>want</em> to use NHibernate but I <em>don't</em> want to do it the wrong way. Help! :)</p>

<p>In my opinion, one of the best features of ASP.Net is the ability to write server controls (although, admittedly, the event model is horrendous to deal with). If these controls are self-populating, then they can be shared between different projects with the minimum of fuss - you simply reference the assembly where the server control lives, and drop it on to the aspx. The control does the rest. This fits very nicely in the World of Widgets and provides efficient code reuse. How is one meant to achieve the same thing in MVC?</p>

<p>I am most interested in self-populating controls that do not post back, as I appreciate that the postback model definitely does not fit with MVC. Can they still be encapsulated in a class that can be shared between a number of different MVC web projects? Or does this require a whole different mindset where controls <em>shouldn't</em> populate themselves, and one should use partial views? Is there a way of sharing partial views between projects?</p>

<p>Finally, can I use my old (non-postback) server controls, in an MVC projects?</p>

<p>I'd dearly like not to have to build my own caching class - it's well known that these provide common points of failure. It would be far better to use a class that somebody else has developed rather than spend a huge amount of my own time debugging a home-made caching system.</p>

<p>Java developers have this:
<a href=""http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>It's a general purpose high-performance caching class which can support all kinds of storage. It's got options for time-based expiry and other methods for garbage-collecting. It looks really good. Unfortunately I cannot find anything this good for Python.</p>

<p>So, can somebody suggest a cache-class that's ready for me to use. My wish-list is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ability to limit the number of objects in the cache.</li>
<li>Ability to limit the maximum age of objects in the cache.</li>
<li>LRU object expirey</li>
<li>Ability to select multiple forms of storage ( e.g. memory, disk )</li>
<li>Well debugged, well maintained, in use by at least one well-known application.</li>
<li>Good performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, any suggestions?</p>

<p>UPDATE: I'm looking for LOCAL caching of objects. The server which I connect to is already heavily cached. Memcached is not appropriate because it requires an additional network traffic between the Windows client and the server. </p>

A resource representation should contain just the resource, which the URI identifies. I'm wondering when it is sensible to present resource's sub-resources within the parent resource? </p>

<p>To elaborate, consider this:
Company may have multiple employees. Usually this situation would probably be designed as two separate resources, company and employee, where employee would be company's sub-resource.</p>

<pre><code>/company/acme/
/company/acme/employees/
/company/acme/employee/john
</code></pre>

<p>With this URI design, company representation should include links to its employees, but the XML representation probably would not include emplyoyees per se. </p>

<p>Therefore, when does it make sense present sub-items through the parent? And is there a situation where it would be sensible to present sub-item <strong>only</strong> through their parent. I mean that there would be no URI for sub-items at all. They could be reached only through the parent resource. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;company&gt;
&lt;name&gt;Acme&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;employees&gt;
  &lt;employee&gt;John&lt;/employee&gt;
  &lt;employee&gt;Jack&lt;/employee&gt;
 &lt;/employees&gt;
&lt;/company&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Is it sensible to offer only one method to access a resource: if a parent exposes its sub-items, can there be an explicit URI for the sub-items too? So, if the company's XML contains company's employees, would it make sense to offer /company/acme/employees URI dispite that you can get the same information through the company resource?</p>

The strings are pulled in from a variety of sources (including user input) and are then compared. However I'm running into problems when comparing space '32' to non-breaking space '160'. To the user they look the same and so they expect a match. But when the app does the compare, there is no match.</p>

<p>What is the best way to go about this? Am I going to have to go to all parts of the code that do a string compare and manually normalize non-breaking spaces to spaces? Does .NET offer anything to help with that? (I've tried all the compare options but none seem to help.)</p>

<p>It has been suggested that I normalize the strings upon receipt and then let the string compare method simply compare the normalized strings. I'm not sure it would be straight-forward to do that because what is a normalized string in the first place. What do I normalize it too? Sure, for now I can convert non-breaking spaces to breaking spaces. But what else can show up? Can there potentially be very many of these rules? Might they even be conflicting. (In one case I want to use a rule and in another I don't.)</p>

"701390","1","","","2009-03-31 14:56:28","","1","1950","<p>After switching from VS2005 to VS2008 SP1, I found an issue that I can't explain.<br>
A program works fine under VS2005 in both release and debug mode. Under VS2008, when entering the debugger an assert is raised.<br>
If I let the program run (in debug or release mode), no assertion at all.</p>

<p>I spent almost two days on this and I don't understand what I do wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Description of the program:</strong>
I have a MFC dialog based program that creates a user thread (CWinThread) that creates the main dialog of the application.<br>
A worker thread loops infinitely and posts each second a message to the dialog. The message is processed in the gui thread.</p>

<p><strong>Some parts of my code:</strong></p>

<p>The InitInstance of the gui thread:</p>

<pre><code>BOOL CGraphicalThread::InitInstance()
{
    CGUIThreadDlg* pDlg = new CGUIThreadDlg();
    pDlg-&gt;Create(CGUIThreadDlg::IDD);
    m_pMainWnd = pDlg;
    AfxGetApp()-&gt;m_pMainWnd = pDlg;
    return TRUE;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The worker thread:</p>

<pre><code>UINT ThreadProc(LPVOID pVoid)
{
    do
    {
        AfxGetApp()-&gt;m_pMainWnd-&gt;PostMessage(WM_APP+1, (WPARAM)new CString(""Hello""), NULL);
        Sleep(1000);
    }
    while(!bStopThread);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The dialog message handler is like this:</p>

<pre><code>LRESULT CGUIThreadDlg::OnMsg(WPARAM wp, LPARAM lp)
{
    CListBox* pList = (CListBox*)GetDlgItem(IDC_LIST1);
    CString* ps = (CString*)wp;
    pList-&gt;InsertString(-1, *ps);
    delete ps;
    return 1L;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works perfectly fine with VS2005.
But with VS2008, but as soon as a put a breakpoint and enter the debugging mode, I have an assertion raised ???<br>
wincore.cpp line 906</p>

<pre><code>CObject* p=NULL;
if(pMap)
{
      ASSERT( (p = pMap-&gt;LookupPermanent(m_hWnd)) != NULL ||
              (p = pMap-&gt;LookupTemporary(m_hWnd)) != NULL);
}
ASSERT((CWnd*)p == this);   // must be us
// Note: if either of the above asserts fire and you are
// writing a multithreaded application, it is likely that
// you have passed a C++ object from one thread to another
// and have used that object in a way that was not intended.
// (only simple inline wrapper functions should be used)
//
// In general, CWnd objects should be passed by HWND from
// one thread to another.  The receiving thread can wrap
// the HWND with a CWnd object by using CWnd::FromHandle.
//
// It is dangerous to pass C++ objects from one thread to
// another, unless the objects are designed to be used in
// such a manner.
</code></pre>

<p>If I remove the GUI thread and create the dialog into the CWinApp thread, the problem doesn't occur anymore.</p>

<p>Does anybody have any idea?<br>
Am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

In a c# app inserts are sent in at a high rate to the table.  Currently a row is made using the symbol and DateTime.Now and then inserted.  Occationaly the situation can arise where 2 ticks for the same symbol come in and the datetime.now will return the same time, down to the millisecond.
My question is how can I assure that my inserts do not use the same time for a given symbol.  I fiqure I could have another unique key like rowver or somekind of autonumber in the db as one solution, but even if the insert is successful I dont want there to be duplicte times for a given symbol.  I've also thought about storing the last insert time and just adding a millesecond to it if it is equal.  I'm not sure the best way to go about this.  Also the datetime2 seams to have more precission than the .net datetime, so don't know if I should try to solve this on the server or the client.</p>

<p>I want to keep every insert no matter what and for performance reasons I don't want to go with checking prior values, so the solution I will go with is an identity column.  That will allow me to preserve the order of the inserts while allowing duplicates in the datetime2.</p>

<p>This visualization is currently done by reading commits which are emitted from git in the correct order. For each commit the parents are known, so it's fairly easy to build up the lanes in the correct way.</p>

<p>I'd like to speed up this process by using my own commit pool and linearizing the commits myself. This allows me to reuse existing loaded commits and allows git to emit commits faster because it doesn't have to emit them in the correct order.</p>

<p>However, I'm not sure what algorithm to use to accomplish this. It is important that the building is incremental, as the loading of commits can take a long time (>5 seconds for 100,000 commits, which should all be displayed).</p>

<p>Gitk has gone the same way, and there's a patch <a href=""http://repo.or.cz/w/git.git?a=commitdiff;h=7fcc92bff4f75b69d61d8d32a5326395c20ff587"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Gitk patch"">here</a> that shows how it is implemented, but my TCL skills are weak and the patch isn't very thoroughly commented and a bit hard to follow.</p>

<p>I'd also like this algorithm to be efficient, as it'll have to handle hundreds of thousands of commits. It also has to be displayed in a table, so it's important that access to specific rows is fast.</p>

<p>I'll describe the input I have so far, the output that I want and a few observations.</p>

<p>Input:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a current pool of commits in the form of a hash table that maps commit ids to commit objects. This pool does not have to be complete (have all commits necessary)</li>
<li>I have a separate thread loading in new commits from git, with a callback that can be called every time a new commit is loaded. There is no guaranteed order in which the commits come in, but in most of the cases the next commit is a parent of the previous commit.</li>
<li>A commit object has its own revision id and the revision ids of all its parents</li>
<li>I have a list of branch heads that should be listed. That is, there isn't a single 'top' of the DAG that should be displayed. There also does not have to be a single graph root.</li>
</ul>

<p>Output:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'll need to linearize these commits in topological order. That is, a commit cannot be listed after its parents have been listed. </li>
<li>I also need the 'branch lines' that can be seen in the screenshot above. These probably need to be precomputed as most of them depend on their children.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few remarks:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's necessary to relocate a list of commits. For example, we might have to commits (branch heads) that are unrelated, until a commit shows up which makes one head an ancestor of the other.</li>
<li>Multiple branch tips must be shown</li>
<li>It's important that this process is incremental, so that at least a partial view is available while the data is still loading. This means that new data has to be inserted halfway and that the branch lines have to be readjusted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put simply, I'd like to put an ASP.NET UpdatePanel inside the info window of Google Maps. This would mean that users could interact with my application from within an info window, without refreshing the page and without closing the currently open info window.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if this is possible?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Thank you to all those who have so far responded. Very much appreciated.</p>

<p>What I have gleaned from the answers is that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the update panel has it's own ""mysterious mechanics"" which might be causing the UpdatePanel to not work correctly inside the InfoWindow. Going down the more direct route of using JQuery to make ajax calls to simple web services should eliminate the hidden complexity of the UpdatePanel and enable the functionality I want.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am still intrigued as to why the UpdatePanel approach does not work, and as to why using one would ""break the model"" of Google Maps, when surely an UpdatePanel merely renders as HTML and javascript with a link to the XMLHttpRequest object.</p>

<p>Is it possible to place ASP.NET code inside Google Maps info window?</p>

<p>I'd like to place an UpdatePanel with some AJAXified asp:Button's inside the info window.</p>

<p>AFAICT you simply provide the HTML to place in the info window as a string, so was thinking of rendering a UserControl to a string and placing that string in the info window for the browser to render. Does anyone know if this is likely to work?</p>

<p>If this is not possible in Google maps, does anyone have any idea whether such an implementation would be possible with the corresponding Virtual Earth technology?</p>

<p>1) How do I figure out how many of these files I have <strong>WITHOUT listing</strong> them?
   I've used the s3cmd.rb, aws/s3, and jets3t stuff and the best I can find is a command to count the first 1000 records (really performing GETS on them).</p>

<p>I've been using jets3t's applet as well cause it's really nice to work with but even that I can't list all my objects cause I run out of heap space. (presumably cause it is peforming GETS on all of them and keeping them in memory)</p>

<p>2) How can I just delete a bucket?
   The best thing I've seen is a paralleized delete loop and that has problems cause sometimes it tries to delete the same file. This is what all the 'deleteall' commands that I've ran across do.</p>

<p>What do you guys do who have boasted about hosting millions of images/txts?? What happens when you want to remove it?</p>

<p>3) Lastly, are there alternate answers to this? All of these files are txt/xml files so I'm not even sure S3 is such a concern -- maybe I should move this to a document database of sorts??</p>

<p>What it boils down to is that the amazon S3 API is just straight out missing 2 very important operations -- COUNT and DEL_BUCKET. (actually there is a delete bucket command but it only works when the bucket is empty) If someone comes up with a method that does not suck to do these two operations I'd gladly give up lots of bounty.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Just to answer a few questions. The reason I ask this was I have been for the past year or so been storing hundreds of thousands, more like millions of 2k txt and xml documents. The last time, a couple of months ago, I wished to delete the bucket it literally took DAYS to do so because the bucket has to be empty before you can delete it. This was such a pain in the ass I am fearing ever having to do this again without API support for it.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>this rocks the house!</p>

<p>FAQ</p>

<p><em>Development Platform (Java, .NET, mobile)</em> — will definitely have some affect on the resulting implementation detail of the strategy from a developer perspective but less so from users' point of view.</p>

<p><em>Fools day</em> it is certainly not. Most legacy systems I was asked to work on did not have a clear error handling strategy.</p>

<p><em>Could this be made a community wiki?</em>  No. It seems as a good question and good questions are hard to come up with. </p>

<p><em>What do you mean by the strategy?</em> A long term plan that gives direction, focus, brings consistency and coordination to error and exception handling. In case of a larger team working on software the strategy can be formilised and distributed in a written form.</p>

<p><em>It seems to be duplicate question (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/409563/best-practices-for-exception-management-in-java-or-c"">Best practices for exception management in Java or C</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/99683/which-and-why-do-you-prefer-exceptions-or-return-codes"">Which and why do you prefer exceptions or return codes</a>)</em> These questions deal with a certain perspective on error handling (mostly developer), I'd like to learn more about other perspectives and how they contribute to the overall strategy.</p>

But when the user is on a sidebar, clicks the link, it should take them back to this main page and then send the file after it displays.</p>

<p>I did some research and thought that using the PageComplete event would be well-suited for this, so I created my event handler and put the call to the export code (it keys off of a query string when loaded from the sidebar) inside my PageComplete event handler. But it behaves just the same way - the browser download box pops up and the page is never loaded before or after.</p>

<p>If it helps to understand what I'm doing here is a snippet of the code used to send the list to the user.</p>

<pre><code>Response.Clear();
Response.BufferOutput = true;
Response.ContentType = ""application/ms-excel"";
Response.AppendHeader(""content-disposition"", ""attachment;filename=MyList.xls"");
Response.Write(listManager.ExportLists(mycode));
Response.End();
</code></pre>

<p>I would prefer a way to use a page event to load the page, rather than tinkering with this logic.  But, if there is a clean and easier way to get the file sent, and it allows for loading the page then sending the file, that would be fine too.</p>

<p>Is there another Page event I can use besides PageComplete, or is it possible I am missing something?</p>

<p>EDIT:  Sorry about the verbosity. I realize that I can't change the way HTTP requests work - I'm only looking for an acceptable solution that achieves more or less the same results. It seems like the way to go is to force a refresh of the page after a couple of seconds (thus ensuring that it loads before the file download code is executed) -- so I am looking for a way to do this as the first answer suggests - refresh to a download. (It doesn't have to be delayed either, if there's a way to refresh with no waiting)</p>

<hr>

<p>Why doesn't this code work?</p>

<pre><code>        private void Page_LoadComplete(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
    {
        if (Request.QueryString[""action""] != null)
        {
            if (Request.QueryString[""action""] == ""export"")
            {
                Response.Redirect(""MyHome.aspx?action=exportnow"", false); 
            }

            if (Request.QueryString[""action""] == ""exportnow"")
            {
                ExportMasterList();
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>What it's supposed to do:  after page loading is complete, do a Response.Redirect, reloading itself with a different query string. When it reaches the Page LoadComplete event again, the second time it will trigger the function which writes out the file.</p>

<p>What it actually does: Apparently repeats the same problem twice...  it goes back to the same problem, how do you execute an action after the page loads, or wait until the page completely finishes loading, then trigger a refresh which will execute the action?  Is there no way for ASP.NET to do something by itself without the user clicking on something?</p>

<p>If that's the case, then an auto-refresh after 2 seconds would also be acceptable... but I'm not sure how to do that.</p>

<li><p>I also plan to use real Media Player to render video (or what-so-ever media player), but my concern is if I start multiple Media Players on my test machine, since Media Player will utilize some H/W or some other resources (video card specific memory?) to decode/render the video (not sure, needs guru help to check and confirm), if I start multiple players, are there any potential H/W or resource contention between the players? If there is contention, it is also not actual ens user scenario, i.e. few user will start 100 players on his/her machine. :-)</p></li>

<p>Is there a distributed caching solution (or generic strategy) that allows to both store objects in the cache while maintaining the integrity of the references between them?</p>

<p>To exemplify - Suppose I have an object <code>Foo foo</code> that references an object <code>Bar bar</code> and also and object <code>Foo foo2</code> that references that same <code>Bar bar</code>. If I load <code>foo</code> to the cache, a copy of <code>bar</code> is stored along with it. If I also load <code>foo2</code> to the cache, a separate copy of <code>bar</code> is stored along with that. If I change <code>foo.bar</code> in the cache, the change does not impact <code>foo2.bar</code> :(</p>

<p>Is there an existing distributed cache solution that will enable me to load <code>foo</code>, <code>foo2</code> and <code>bar</code> into the cache while maintaining the <code>foo.bar</code> <code>foo2.bar</code> references?</p>

<p>The question is: since the stub is actually a dynamically generated proxy, its class definition would not be available on the client side, then how come the client is still able to retrieve the stub from the RMI Registry?

<p>xRef and xPtr are both working pointers, with the expected values.<br>
Of course I wouldn't write such code in a real project, but I'm still interested how / why this works.<br>
The only info I found on google about this was that ""if you create a reference to a temporary, the temporaries lifetime is linked to the lifetime of the reference""  </p>

<p>Note :<br>
-not all compilers are that forgiving, e.g. Metrowerks ARM (does it use GCC ?) only allows const reference to temporaries.<br>
EDIT :<br>
-increasing the warning to W4 in VC++ 2008 showed lots of errors - good to know.  </p>

            var tblBody = document.createElement('tbody');
            // get the first row and the remainder
            var headerRow = $(tbl).find('tr:first')
            var bodyRows  = $(tbl).find('tr:not(:first)');

            // remove the original rows
            headerRow.remove();
            bodyRows.remove();

            // add the rows to the header and body respectively
            $(tblHead).append(headerRow);

The main disadvantage is that it only supports lossless compression, which for complex images means a very large file size.</p>

<p>JPEG on the other hand offers great compressibility for complex images, but no transparency.</p>

<p>And finally, I've seen Flash elements (<a href=""http://www.uca.edu/futurestudents/"" rel=""noreferrer"">example here</a>) with highly compressed images that also have smoothed edges and shadows.  I don't know much about Flash and have no idea how this is accomplished.  This is basically the effect I would like to be able to do - a large, complex image with transparent and/or shadowed edges.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<h3>How does lossy compression with transparency work in Flash?</h3>

<p>Are there flash specific layering tricks being used here?  Are the shadows generated or rasterized into the image as I would do with a PNG.</p>

<h3>Are there any SWFs or SWF generating scripts that could replace a PNG image with a lossily compressed version?</h3>

<p>I'm thinking progressive enhancement to improve loading speed of certain design elements.  If this doesn't exist, would it be feasible to write it?</p>

<h3>Are there any formats that allow lossy compression with transparency</h3>

<p>It's been hard for me to find specific info on this.  DjVu might be a candidate?  Should we be pushing browser makers to support another format?</p>

<h3>Are there other solutions to this problem?</h3>

<p>Doing everything in Flash or accepting enormous file sizes are the current options.  Some other possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>SVG and canvas may be able to apply edges, but aren't supported by IE.</li>
<li>You could cut up a PNG along scan lines and compress those with JPEG, leaving the edges as PNG.  This would be nasty in source, but it would work in all browsers.  Sounds like a fun project, I'll write it by the morning. :)</li>
<li>You could write a lossy image filter that can decrease color complexity along the PNG algorithm's scan lines to improve compression within the PNG format.  I just <em>knew</em> this had to exist, but I couldn't find it.  Anyone know of this?</li>
</ul>

<p>The fields that need to be exposed in XML depend on what type of user is making the request. For instance, we have a role for HumanResources and Finance users. A User might be defined as:</p>

<p>@XmlRootElement</p>

<p>public class User {</p>

<p>@XmlElement public String someHumanResourceData;</p>

<p>@XmlElement public String someFinanceData;</p>

<p>I want HR users to see the HR data, and Finance to see the Finance data, but nothing more than that. HR should not see Finance data.</p>

<p>Is there a recommended approach on how to do this? What are some search terms I could use to lookup more information on the Web?</p>

<p>A few ideas that I don't find appealing:
1) I could use subclassing to expose a FinanceUser and HumanResourceUser that only has the relevant data, and a parent User with the shared data. However, this is fragile and may work on a small example, I feel I need a more flexible, compositional approach for production.
2) A co-worker recommends a ""shopping cart"" approach in which the client requests what fields he/she wants with each request. I'm not finding a standard way to do this or even many other people who have done this approach. It sounds really home-grown and labor intensive to me.</p>

<p>A user can start a new revision of an essay, save it, resume it or submit it (for scoring).
Once the revision is submitted it is marked as a COMPLETE and it is not later changed. 
If the user starts a new revision the previous response will be copied to the current revision. 
If the user resumes the revision - he works with the current revision (that is IN PROGRESS).
The saved but not submitted revision is 'IN PROGRESS' state.</p>

<p>We need to design an API that would allow to do the same things in the client app. </p>

<p>As the first step we need to get the latest version of the essay (it might be in progress or complete or not existing yet (so return just a template)).</p>

<pre> GET user/{userid}/revisions/mostrecent </pre>

<p>The format of revision would be sth like this</p>

<pre><code> &lt;revision&gt;
     &lt;id&gt; &lt;/id&gt;
     &lt;response&gt; &lt;/response&gt;
     &lt;status&gt; &lt;/status&gt;
 &lt;/revision&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Later the client app should send the changed revision. <br></p>

<p>However I am not sure how to deal with different states of the essay revision ('IN PROGRESS', 'COMPLETE'), i.e. should the client app perform different
PUT/POST operation based on the revision state or should it just POST sth and everything should be handled server-side (i believe it not RESTful API then)?</p>

<p>I would think that sending a new revision would be:
<PRE> POST user/{userid}/revisions</PRE></p>

<p>And updating the current revision:
<PRE> PUT user/{userid}/revisions/{id} </PRE></p>

<p>But how to distinguish that the revision should only be saved not submitted (by setting the status to 'INPROGRESS')?</p>

<p>And how to prevent from creating multiple IN PROGRESS revisions (the POST wouldn't be executed if there is already 'INPROGRESS' revision)? <br></p>

<p>How to prevent from updating the previous revisions (if status = COMPLETE then PUT is forbidden?)</p>

<p>This gives me a resizeable native Windows window which is much better than the standard ""DOS box"" the default <code>cygwin.bat</code> provides.</p>

<p>However, the current configuration does have a couple of issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>I am not able to enter non-ASCII characters into the terminal window (i.e. æ, ø, å and Æ, Ø, Å, which I use semi-frequently. In fact, the terminal will not even accept them when I paste them into the window. If I paste a string like ""bølle"" (Norwegian for ""bulley""), all I get is ""blle"".</li>
<li>I am not able to render UTF-8 character, they only show as ?, even if they are supported by the font (i.e. when rendering the same characters in ISO-8859-1 they show just fine.).</li>
</ol>

<p>I am running English Windows Vista with locale and keyboard layout set to Norwegian (ISO-8859-1 character set?), but I've had the exact same issue on Windows 2000 and XP.</p>

<p>Anyone knows how to fix this (i.e. a better way to configure rxvt)?</p>

<p>Apart from the issues mentioned above, I'm very happy with <code>rxvt</code>, so if I find a way to resolve them I'd like to continue using it. However, if the issues are not (easily) solvable, are the any other good terminal solutions for Cygwin?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>The solution provided by Andy and Mattias (editing the <code>.inputrc</code> file) did solve the input problem, but output rendering is still an issue. Output is fine when I render in ISO-8859-1, but when using UTF-8 I only get ? for non-ASCII characters. This behavior is consistent between <code>rxvt</code>, <code>urxvt</code> (under Cygwin XFree X Server), <code>mintty</code> and PuttyCyg. </p>

<p>Is there a similar configuration file where output encoding can be set (i.e. the equivalent of setting output locale on a Linux system)?</p>

However the example is for a very simple model of pure properties. What about associations?</p>

<p>Say if <code>Product</code> model has an association to the <code>Users</code> table through <i>Owner</i> association. The controller calls the service or the repository to get a list of users, pass it to View, and View displays the users as a drop-down list.</p>

<p>Then on a standard POST: product/Create, controller needs to get the chosen userID, then grab the User entity of that id, and associate it with the to be created Product. </p>

<pre><code>  if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(Request[""SelectedUserId""]))
        {
            int selectedUserId = Convert.ToInt16(Request[""SelectedUserId""]);
            newProduct.Owner = _productService.GetUserById(ownerId);
        }

  _productService.AddProduct(newProduct);
</code></pre>

<p>But this process complicates the controller logic. Even worse if we need to validate the associations (since there wouldn't be OnChanging events for the associations, we can't do it in the Model partial class). </p>

<p>My question is, is there any better way to handle associations? Is it better to pass the Request parameters to the service layers as well and do everything there? What about validations?</p>

<p>I've not enough experience with Flex, but quite a lot with Flash, but that error tells me nothing at all. I haven't heard of any properties of the stage object or whatever called MainTimeline. Could someone tell me why I get the error or why what I'm doing is just plain stupid?</p>

<p>I wonder then, why this feature is in the language? Could it be that the language creators believed that sometimes you need an elegant way to achieve a solution even if it's expensive to do so?

<li>tree depth is not explicitly limited</li>
<li>the labels however are meant to be the same across all sheets, which means they can be used for grouping</li>
</ul>

I assume that the location given by this utility for, say, printf, is the location where printf is in memory and that every program that calls printf will reach that location during execution.

<p>Is there any way to get a list of locations for all the library/system functions?

The code for saving is inside of an If Me.IsValid with no ELSE specified, but after the save function is called it proceeds to display a 'saved' message and redirect the page.

<p>The first instance of the model raises an error. I catch the error and generate a slug field from the title. In a second instance, it doesn't throw the error. I checked the value of instance._get_pk_val() on both instances and they are the same: None</p>

<p>So:</p>

<pre><code># This one raises an error in the sluggit function
instance1 = Model(title=""title 1"")
instance1.save()

# This one doesn't raise an error
instance2 = Model(title=""title 2"")
instance2.save()

<p>This is my 3rd day messing around with python and django. So I am sorry if it something newbish that I am not seeing.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p>

<p>The Model:</p>

<pre><code>class Test(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=128)
    slug.prepopulate_from=('title',)

signals.pre_save.connect(package.sluggit, sender=Test)

        sender.objects.get(pk=instance._get_pk_val())
    except:
        # Generate Slug Code

<p>@S.Lot told me to override the save() method in the comments. I'll have to try that. I would still like to know why the second call to model.objects.get() isn't raising an error with this method.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>
Thank you @S.Lot. Overriding the save method works perfectly. Still curious about the signal method. Hmm, weird.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>
After playing around a little more, I found that using instance.objects.get() instead of sender.objects.get() works:</p>

<pre><code>def sluggit(sender, instance, signal, *args, **kwargs):
    try:
        sender.objects.get(pk=instance._get_pk_val())
    except:

<p>needs to be:</p>

<pre><code>def sluggit(sender, instance, signal, *args, **kwargs):
    try:
        instance.objects.get(pk=instance._get_pk_val())
    except:

I started out with <a href=""http://snakelets.sf.net"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""Snakelets"">Snakelets</a> and heartily enjoyed being able to control almost everything at a lower level without much fuss, but then I discovered <a href=""http://turbogears.org"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""TurboGears"">TurboGears</a> and I have been using it (1.x) ever since. Tools like Catwalk and the web console are invaluable to me.</p>

<p>But with TurboGears 2 coming out which brings WSGI support, and after reading up on the religious debates between the Django and WSGI camps, I'm really torn between <strong><em>""doing it the right way""</em></strong>, e.g., learning WSGI, spending valuable time writing functionality that already exists in Django and other full-stack frameworks, as opposed to using Django or some high-level framework that does everything for me. The downsides with the latter that I can see are pretty obvious: </p>

<ol>
<li>I'm not learning anything in the process</li>
<li>If I ever need to do anything lower level it's going to be a pain</li>
<li>The overhead required for just a basic site which uses authentication is insane. (IMO)</li>
</ol>

<p>So, I guess my question is, which is the better choice, or is it just a matter of opinion, and should I suck it up and use Django if it achieves what I want with minimal fuss (I want authentication and a CRUD interface to my database)? I tried Werkzeug, Glashammer, and friends, but AuthKit and Repoze scared me off, as well as the number of steps involved to just setup basic authentication. I looked at Pylons, but the documentation seems lacking, and when referencing simple features like authentication or a CRUD interface, various wiki pages and documentation seemed to contradict each other, with different hacks for versions and such. </p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks to S. Lott for pointing out that I wasn't clear enough. My question is: which of the following is worthwhile in the long run, but not painful in the short (e.g., some sort of middle ground, anyone?) - Learn WSGI, or stick with a ""batteries-included"" framework? If the latter, I would appreciate a suggestion as to whether I should give Django another try, stick with TurboGears 1.x, or venture into some other framework. </p>

<p>Also, I have tried CherryPy, but couldn't seem to find a good enough CRUD application that I could plop in and use right away.</p>

<p>For any <strong>databound control (eg. Repeater, GridView, etc)</strong> I always implement the OnDataBinding method for field level controls if I need to do anything that isn't built in out of the box (eg. I need to do an Eval).  Most examples I see have the code right in the aspx page using the inline &lt;%# syntax.</p>

<p>Example of inline ASP.NET code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:Literal ID=""litExample"" runat=""server""
    Text='&lt;%# Eval(""ExampleField"").ToString() %&gt;' /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Example of how I prefer to do it:</p>

<p>In the aspx:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:Literal ID=""litExample"" runat=""server"" 
    OnDataBinding=""litExample_DataBinding"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the codebehind .cs:</p>

<pre><code>protected void litExample_DataBinding(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    Literal lit = (Literal)(sender);
    lit.Text = string.Format(""{1} - {2}"",
        Eval(""ExampleField"").ToString(),
        Eval(""ExampleField2"").ToString());
}
</code></pre>

<p>I personally prefer the codebehind method because it keeps my aspx pages clean and I don't have all this inline code all over the place and the next guy just knows to always look in the .cs files for code changes. The seperation of presentation and code is also maintained better this way as the HTML is place holders only and the codebind is determining what is actually being put in control.</p>

<p>Now these are very basic examples. The field could be a integer that you want to format with leading 0s or a DateTime that needs a specific format etc.  It could also take all sort of manipulation and code to get the finally value that should be stored in the 'Text' property at the end.</p>

<p>Where do you draw the line and move it to the codebehind if you are using inline code?</p>

<p>What are the pros and cons for doing it either way?</p>

<p>Does one take more overhead than the other?</p>

<p><strong>Edit Note:</strong> I am not talking about assigning a value to a control that is just on the page but one that is being databound to because it exists in a repeater template or gridview item template etc...  Obviously a literal sitting on a page you can just assign in code.</p>

<p><strong>Edit Note:</strong> I thought I would gather more response, especially with regards to the overhead.  Do most people NOT use the OnDataBinding events?</p>

<p>Do you know if it affects how event data is routed? It appears that adding a second event handler causes <code>eventObject.data</code> property to return <code>undefined</code>...?</p>

<hr>

<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p>The problem was somehow related to the way jQuery normalizes event handling and how the <code>eventObject</code> data property changed depending on routing, I had a delay timer at one point which read the property at a later time when it was undefined, I solved it by simply creating a local temporary for it.</p>

<pre><code>obj.inputText.bind('blur', obj, function(e) {
    var div = e.data.div;

I realize that I could query the 'member' attribute of the group to get the dn of every member and then make a separate LDAP query for the attributes of each member. I am hoping however, that there is a single query that I can perform that would return all of the results at once however, in order to prevent excess back-and-forth between the PHP app and the LDAP server (AD).</p>

<p>Using an <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=ldap+browser+Jarek+Gawor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LDAP browser</a> I can successfully run a search over my full domain:</p>

<pre><code>Search DN:  DC=middlebury,DC=edu
Filter: (memberOf=CN=BG_Cells,OU=General,OU=Groups,DC=middlebury,DC=edu)
Attributes: objectClass,mail,givenName,sn,sAMAccountName,telephoneNumber
</code></pre>

<p>and get back the expected results. When I try this filter using PHP's <code>ldap_search()</code> method however, I get an <code>Operations error</code> with code <code>1</code>. </p>

<p>Below is the PHP I'm using.</p>

<pre><code>....
$baseDN = 'DC=middlebury,DC=edu';
$filter = '(memberOf=CN=BG_Cells,OU=General,OU=Groups,DC=middlebury,DC=edu)';
$attributes = array('objectClass','mail','givenName','sn','sAMAccountName','telephoneNumber');

$result = ldap_search($connection, $baseDN, $filter, $attributes);

if (ldap_errno($connection))
    print ""Read failed for $filter with message: "".ldap_error($connection)."", #"".ldap_errno($ connection));
</code></pre>

<p>Other filters work just fine with these attributes and using just <code>array('mail')</code> or an empty array for the attributes does not get rid of the error result, so I'm sure the problem is with my filter rather than the connection or attribute set.</p>

<p>A second option would be to do one query for the group member dns in the 'member' field of the group and then build a long OR query with every member dn. This still would involve two queries however.</p>

<p>So is there a better way to get each member's attributes, ideally in one query?</p>

"702367","1","","","2009-03-31 18:13:01","","1","514","<p>I'm having trouble designing a good architecture for a particular portion of my application, especially where maintaining state is involved.</p>

<p>I have a group of parsing operations:</p>

<p>My class <code>Reader</code> reads in a block of data into a buffer and handles the overall control flow.
My class <code>Parser</code> takes the block of data in the buffer and a <code>ParsedDataHandler</code>, and divides it up into smaller chunks for the <code>ParsedDataHandler</code> to manage.</p>

<p><code>ParsedDataHandler</code> is an interface that I am trying to design; I think I want to do something like this (""BlockInfo"" represents some data structure containing various bits of state that will include a ByteBuffer holding the entire block of raw data. ""ChunkMetadata"" represents information including the position of each chunk within the block, and any other information the <code>Parser</code> has determined about the chunk)</p>

<pre><code>interface ParsedDataHandler
{
    void beginBlock(BlockInfo bi);
    void handleParsedData(BlockInfo bi, ChunkMetadata m);
    void endBlock(BlockInfo bi);
}
</code></pre>

<p>so <code>Reader</code> will call <code>ParsedDataHandler.beginBlock()</code> to let it set up any state at the beginning of a block, and is committed to leaving a designated portion (probably all) of the BlockInfo constant until it makes a matching call to <code>ParsedDataHandler.endBlock()</code> -- afterwards it might reuse the data buffer for the next block. <code>Parser</code> runs through the data block and splits it into chunks according to a predefined data protocol, and will call <code>ParsedDataHandler.handleParsedData()</code> multiple times, once for each chunk. One reason for the contract to include a buffer that remains fixed, is so that <code>ParsedDataHandler</code> can copy the whole block of data at the beginning or end, and doesn't have to reassemble the chunks into the one block when they were there together all the time.</p>

<p>So there's a division of responsibility:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Reader</code> is just responsible for managing the overall routine and reading in the data, it couldn't care less about anything else. </li>
<li><code>Parser</code> is the thing that splits the data block into chunks and it couldn't care less about what to do with them or how the data got there</li>
<li><code>ParsedDataHandler</code> is the interface I'm trying to design so that concrete classes can implement it and work correctly, without <code>Reader</code> or <code>Parser</code> caring what it does, or without it caring about how to divide up the block into chunks or where the data came from.</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is, should the burden on maintaining any state be on the class implementing <code>ParsedDataHandler</code> and kept out of BlockInfo? And if the semantics of my interface include the fact that the raw data block in BlockInfo will not change between calls of beginBlock() and endBlock(), should I then only pass it in to beginBlock() and not to the other calls? or is it okay to send it along for convenience's sake?</p>

<p>Is there a better design pattern to handle a situation like this?</p>

<p>The user isn't supposed to tell me in advance what he's searching for, and I also want support of combined search (AND-concatenation of search terms). For example ""lincoln+lond"" should search for all records containing both search terms in any of the search fields, also those entries starting with any of the terms (like ""London"" in this example).</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Now I need to choose an indexing strategy for this search table. (As a side note: I'm trying to achieve sub-second response time, worst response time should be 2 seconds.) What's better in terms of perfomance:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do a combined index out of all queryable columns (would need 2 of them, as index limit of 900 bytes reached) </li>
<li>Put single indexes on each of the queryable columns</li>
<li>Make a fulltext index on the queryable columns and use fulltext query</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm discarding point 1, as it doesn't seem to have any advantage (index usage will be limited and there will be no ""index seek"", because not all fields fit in one single index).</p>

<p>Two options I've considered:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use domain aliasing for static content on the site, including CSS, JS, and some images.</li>
<li>Use ""edge side includes"" to designate static content regions.</li>
</ol>

<p>(1) is simpler and I've implemented it before. For example, we would prefix each IMG src with <a href=""http://images1.mysite.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://images1.mysite.com/</a>, and then later update the corresponding DNS to use the CDN. The drawback I've heard from users of our internal ""pre-production"" site is that they would have to push the images to images1.mysite.com to preview their changes internally -- ideally, files would not get pushed to images1.mysite.com until they're ready for production. (NOTE - hosts file changes and DNS tricks are not an option here.)</p>

<p>Instead, they would like to simply use relative or absolute paths for static content. e.g. /images/myimage.gif</p>

<p>(2) is not as familiar to me and I would like more info. Would this allow our ""pre-production"" team to reference static content with a relative path in ""pre-production environment"" and yet have it work with the CDN in production without HTML modifications?</p>

<p>Could someone compare the two options, in terms of ease of development, flexibility, and cost?</p>

<p>There's one problem, however. If a card is swiped at any point before the serial port is opened, the entire system freezes at the <code>Open()</code> call.

<p>How you take the above code one step further and add and work with friends?</p>

  has_many :friends # what comes here?

<p>In the code above I also added actions.  Let's say that the system kept track of each user's actions on the site.  How would you code this so that each action was unique and sorted with the most recent at the top for all the user's friends?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% for action in @user.friends.actions %&gt;
 &lt;%= action.whatever %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

<p>The code above may not be valid, you could do something like what I have below, but then the actions wouldn't be sorted.</p>

 &lt;% for action in friend.actions %&gt;
  &lt;%= action.whatever %&gt;

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I guess the real issue here is how to define friends?  Do I create a new model or join table that links users to other users?  Ideally, I'd like to define friends through the common group memberships of other users, but I'm not sure how to go about defining that.</p>

<pre><code>has_many :friends, :through =&gt; :group_memberships, :source =&gt; :user

<p>IIS enables us to also configure Asp.Net file mappings. Thus besides aspx,  IIS also invokes Asp.Net runtime, when requests have the following file extensions:
<br /><br /></p>

<p>a) .ascx --> .asmx  extension is used to request user controls. </p>

<ul>
<li>Since user controls can’t be accessed directly, how and why would anyone send a request to a user control?
<br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<p>b) .ashx --> this extension is used for HTTP handlers. 
<br /></p>

<p>• But why would you want to request an .ashx page directly instead of registering this handler inside configuration file and enable it to be called when files with certain ( non ashx  ) extensions are requested?
<br /></p>

<p>• Besides, since there can be several Http handlers registered, how will Asp.Net know which handler to invoke if they all use ashx extension? 
<br /></p>

<p>• What does the requested ashx file contain? Perhaps a definition of a Http handler class?
<br /></p>

<p>• I know how we register Http handlers to be invoked when non-ashx pages are requested, but how do we register Http handler for ashx page?</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>c) .asax --> This extension is used to request a global application file</p>

<p>• Why would we ever want to call Global.asax directly?<br>
<br />
• I assume that when request is made for Global.asax, an object derived from HTtpApplication class is created, except this time no web page processing takes place?</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>thanx</p>

<hr>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>Q - Besides Asp.Net being able to request  global.asax for compilation, is there any other reason why I would choose to request file with .asax extension directly? </p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>• ashx files don't have to be registered. They are basically a simpler aspx, for when you don't need the entire page life cycle. A common use is for retrieving dynamic images from a database.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if I write a Http handler, I should put it in a file with .ashx extension and Asp.Net will build an HttpHandler object  similarly to how it builds a page instance from .aspx file? </p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>• If a hacker did try to make a request for one of these files, what would you want to happen? You certainly wouldn't want IIS to treat it like a text file and send the source for your app down to the browser.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Asp.Net could do the same it does with .cs, .csproj, .config, .resx, .licx, .webinfo file types. Namely, it registers these file types  with IIS so that it can explicitly prevent users from accessing these files</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>•Just because you don't expect requests from the browser for a resource, it doesn't mean you don't want that resource handled by the asp.net engine. These extensions are also how ASP.Net picks up files to compile for the web site model sites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But then why doesn’t Asp.Net also allow .cs, .csproj, .config, .resx, .licx, .webinfo files to be directly requested? </p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a)    and c) - as far as I am aware, these are not exposed to process any external requests</p>
</blockquote>

<p>my book claims the two are mapped in IIS</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>I appreciate your help</p>

<p>EDIT:
<br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>b) The .ashx extention is defined in a config file it's just not the web.config, its in the machine.config </p>
  
  <p><code>&lt;add path=""*.ashx"" verb=""*"" type=""System.Web.UI.SimpleHandlerFactory"" validate=""True"" /&gt;</code> 
  <br />
  <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bya7fh0a.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bya7fh0a.aspx</a></p>
  
  <p>Why use .ashx: The difference is that the .NET class that handles a .ashx reads the Page directive in the .ashx file to map the request to a class specified in that directive. This saves you from having to put an explicit path in the web.config for every handler that you have, which could result in a very long web.config.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought Http handler class was defined inside .ashx file, but instead file with .ashx extension only contains Page directive?</p>

<p>Since I’m not 100% sure if I understand this correctly: Say  we have ten Http handlers we want to invoke by making a request to IIS7. I assume for each Http handler there will be specific .ashx file --> thus if request is made for FirstHandler.asxh, then handler specified inside that file will be invoked?</p>

<p><strong>YET ANOTHER EDIT:</strong>
<br /><br />
I must confess that I’m still a bit unsure about ashx extension.
<br /></p>

<p>I realize that by using it we can for example create 'hey.ashx' page, where Page directive will tell which class ( Http handler) to invoke when request is made for 'hey.ashx' – thus no need to register Http handler in web.config. 
<br /></p>

<p>But if you use Http handlers that way, then they will only get invoked when requests are made for files with .ashx extension. Thus, if I want Http handler to be invoked for files with other extensions, such as .sourceC, then I will still need to register Http handler in web.config?!</p>

<p>The problem is that the browser is mangling characters in the Basic Auth credentials before it sends them to my service.  For testing, I'm using 'カタカナカタカナカタカナカタカナカタカナカタカナカタカナカタカナ' as my username (no idea what it means - AFAIK it's some random characters our QA guy came up with - please forgive me if it is somehow offensive).</p>

<p>If I take that as a string and do username.unpack(""h*"") to convert it to hex, I get: '3e28ba3e28fb3e28ba3e38a83e28ba3e28fb3e28ba3e38a83e28ba3e28fb3e28ba3e38a83e28ba3e28fb3e28ba3e38a83e28ba3e28fb3e28ba3e38a83e28ba3e28fb3e28ba3e38a83e28ba3e28fb3e28ba3e38a83e28ba3e28fb3e28ba3e38a8'  That seems about right for 32 kanji characters (3 bytes/6 hex digits per).</p>

<p>If I do the same with the username that's coming in via HTTP Basic auth, I get:
'bafbbaacbafbbaacbafbbaacbafbbaacbafbbaacbafbbaacbafbbaacbafbbaac'.  It's obviously much shorter.  Using the Firefox Live HTTP Headers plugin, here's the actual header that's being sent:</p>

<pre><code>Authorization: Basic q7+ryqu/q8qrv6vKq7+ryqu/q8qrv6vKq7+ryqu/q8o6q7+ryqu/q8qrv6vKq7+ryqu/q8qrv6vKq7+ryqu/q8o=
</code></pre>

<p>That looks like that 'bafbba...' string, with the high and low nibbles swapped (at least when I paste it into Emacs, base 64 decode, then switch to hexl mode).  That might be a UTF16 representation of the username, but I haven't gotten anything to display it as anything but gibberish.</p>

<p>Rails is setting the content-type header to UTF-8, so the browser should be sending in that encoding.  I get the correct data for form submissions.</p>

<p>The problem happens in both Firefox 3.0.8 and IE 7.</p>

<p>So... is there some magic sauce for getting web browsers to send UTF-8 characters via HTTP Basic Auth?  Am I handling things wrong on the receiving end?  Does HTTP Basic Auth just not work with non-ASCII characters?</p>

<p>Here's my thought - when you submit your un/pw, it obviously goes to the Login Controller. We need to look up that un/pw combo in the user database, and therefore I feel as if that should be done in the in the user object ... $User->authenticate($un, $pw). </p>

<p>All that should do i return true or false. Then the LoginController should tell the Session object to create a session ... $session->create(). But apart of me wonders if the User and Session object should be a bit closer knit, and not rely on a Controller.</p>

For example, my main application would simply contain the basics to start the interface, load the modules, connect to the server, etc. These modules, in the form of class libraries, would contains their own logic and WPF windows. Modules could define their own resource dictionaries and all pull from the main application's resource dictionary for common brushes and such.</p>

<p>What's the best way to implement a system of this nature? How should the main interface be built so that the modules it loads can alter virtually any aspect of its user interface and logic?</p>

<p>Edit: To clarify, I can't work out where the bad calculation is.  This is why I want the debugger to break automatically.  Setting breakpoints is not a solution.</p>

I understood the basic concepts: account, entry, transaction, etc; but I am not quite clear when it comes to the money flow when external funds flow into the system. To make sure that no money is created or destroyed, I use transactions (2 legged) so that each entry in the transaction is the opposite of the other. Say I am a contractor, when a customer pays me $1000, how should I record this transaction? </p>

<p>What I can think of now is that I set up income accounts for customers: one customer will have one income account; I will have my balance account. When a customer pays me $1000, the transaction will have two entries: one with -$1000 on the customer income account, the other with +$1000 on my balance account. This way, it mimics the cash flow from the customer to me (the contractor). The customer income account will be decreased as the customer makes more payments, e.g. -$1000, -$2000, -$3000, etc. Does this make sense? Is there any better way to model this cash flow? </p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your help/advice.</p>

<p>This all works fine when it's all running on the main thread. However one of the motivations for splitting this out this way was so that the offscreen part could be run on a background thread (which I had thought should be ok since it's not rendering to an onscreen context).</p>

<p>However, when I do this the resulting image is empty! I've checked over the code, and placed judicious NSLog's to verify that everything is happening in the right order.</p>

<p>My next step is to boil this down to the simplest code that reproduces the issue (or find some silly thing I'm missing and fix it) - at which point I'd have some code to post here if necessary. But I first wanted to check here that I'm not going down the wrong path with this. I couldn't find anything in my travels around the googlesphere that sheds light either way - but a friend did mention that he ran into a similar issue while trying to resize images in a background thread - suggesting there may be some general limitation here.</p>

<p>[edit]</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses so far. If nothing else they have told me that at least I'm not alone in not having an answer for this - which was part of what I wanted to find out. At this point I'm going to put the extra work into getting the simplest possible example and may come back with some code or more information. In the meantime keep any ideas coming :-)</p>

<p>One point to bring up: A couple of people have used the term <em>thread safety</em> with respect to APIs. It should be noted that there are two types of thread safety in this context:</p>

<ol>
<li>Threadability of the API itself - ie can it be used at all from more than one thread (global state and other re-entrancy issues such as C's strtok are common reasons that an API might not be thread safe too).</li>
<li>Atomicity of individual operations - can multiple threads interact with the same objects and resources through API without application level locking?</li>
</ol>

<p>I suspect that mention so far has been of the first type, but would appreciate if you could clarify.</p>

<p>[edit2 - solved!]</p>

<p>Ok, I got it all working. Executive summary is that the problem was with me, rather than bitmap contexts themselves.</p>

<p>In my background thread, just before I drew into the bitmap context, I was doing some preparation on some other objects. It turns out that, indirectly, the calls to those other objects where leading to setNeedsDisplay being called on some views!
By separating the part that did that out to the main thread it now all works perfectly.</p>

<p>So for anyone who hits this question wondering if they can draw to a bitmap context on a background thread, the answer is you can (with the caveats that have been presented here and in the answers).</p>

<p>I can look through the output of cvsps (saved in my ~/.cvsps directory) and see a patchset for a major, complicated commit.  But this commit does not show up when I do cvsimport to update my existing git repository.  I know that git-cvsimport will ignore patchsets that are newer than 10 minutes, in an effort to avoid importing a CVS commit that is incomplete.  I think I've also heard that it will skip patchsets for which the associated branch cannot be identified.  What other reasons might be causing git-cvsimport to be ignoring my commit?  How can I debug this?</p>

<p>Here is a little bit of the cvsps output:</p>

<pre><code>patchset: 50064

author: skiphoppy
tag: 
tag_flags: 0
branch: HEAD 
branch_add: 1

file:deletedFileGoneBecauseRenamed; pre_rev:1.2; post_rev:1.3; dead:1; branch_point:0
...
</code></pre>

<p>Does that branch_add: 1 line have anything to do with it?  There are only 9 such commits in the entire repository; the other 50090 commits say branch_add: 0.  Other than that I don't know what the differences are from a cvsps or git-cvsimport point of view.  The commit was complicated, involving renaming several files and making associated content modifications.  Definitely difficult for CVS to handle.  A snap for git, of course, but hard for git to handle when the real backend is CVS.</p>

<p>I've got to perform the same type of complicated commit three more times, and I can't afford to spend 4 1/2 hours each time to reimport a brand new git repository from CVS due to cvsimport not being able to see my commit.</p>

<p>More importantly, I'm frightened by the fact that my daily runs of git-cvsimport (which I intended to put into cron, or even write a daemon to run every five minutes or so) might <strong><em>miss</em></strong> commits in the future!  I have found no way to git an existing repository to pick up these commits; I can only run git-cvsimport in a brand new repository and wait forever, losing the use of many of my other branches while I'm at it.</p>

<p>As an example of the problem I'm facing in our system...</p>

<p>We have 6 different business entity assemblies representing the same things but with different properties.  They have been created by several developers concerned with different problems over a period of several years.   </p>

<p>For example different applications using the ""Bicycle"" class over the years were concerned with different properties of the bicycle.  So they called different data methods that only retrieved and populated the properties they were concerned with.</p>

<p>Data Service 1 Populates</p>

<ul>
<li>Brand</li>
<li>Color</li>
</ul>

<p>Data Service 2 Populates</p>

<ul>
<li><h1>Gears</h1></li>
<li>Tire Size</li>
</ul>

<p>and each uses a different business entity.  Clearly this is ridiculous, you can't be creating a new class for every possible combination of properties.</p>

<p>My gut feeling tells me that if this is a problem then we should probably be using an ORM.</p>

<p>But for the time being I want to say.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you are populating or returning an entire row from a table then use the DTO / Business Entity that matches the database.  </p></li>
<li><p>If you are returning a random set of properties then use a datatable.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Could anybody offer some guidance?</p>

<p>192.168.1.45 is the second IP that it attempts to bind to. At the point that it throws the exception I can see (using netstat) that the program has bound to the first IP in the list on port 4329. There isn't anything bound to port 4329 on the address mentioned in the exception.</p>

It appears the capability of determining a CD's free space is beyond the WMI and is reliant on the file system of the disk inserted.

<p>By reading the MSDN documentation I found this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You cannot apply the IsNullable property to a member typed as a value type because a value type cannot contain nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic). Additionally, you cannot set this property to false for nullable value types. When such types are nullNothingnullptra null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic), they will be serialized by setting xsi:nil to true. </p>

<p>I understand a value type can't be set to null. A valuetype is always set to something. The serialization can't make the decision to serialize it or not based on it's current value.</p>

<p>I tried with the attributes, but it didn't work out. I tried creating an agecontainer object and manipulate it's serialization with attributes, but it didn't work out.</p>

<p>What I really want is:</p>

  <p>Looks like you'll have to implement custom serialization.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's what I though too, but I'd like to get away without it.</p>

<p>So what is <strong>supposed</strong> to happen if you combine this with an unsigned integer conversion? Clearly o,u,x and X all all intended to be interpreted as unsigned values, while d and i are signed.</p>

<p>Likewise, there are signed/unsigned versions for all modifiers (int/unsigned int, <code>size_t</code>/ <code>ssize_t</code>, etc) except <code>ptrdiff_t</code>.</p>

<p>In practice, nothing bad happens since unsigned versions of types occupy the same amount of space as the signed versions. So the right about of bytes get popped off the stack.</p>

<p>This is a web-based form with PHP doing the calculations, though this question probably has an algorithmic or language agnostic answer. </p>

<p>Essentially, there is an Amount field and a Charge Code field. 
The Charge code entered represents a short-hand for several 'agents' to whom the Amount is divided by. Most cases are single letters, however there are a couple cases where this varies, and gives a bit of trouble. </p>

<p>Basically, A = AgentType1, J = AgentType2, L = AgentType3, and as paperwork and user requirements would have it, ""A2"" is also a valid replacement for ""J"". </p>

<p>So an amount of 50 and a Charge Code of ""AJ"" would result in the Amount being divided by 2 (two agents) and dispersed accordingly. The same for a string like ""AA2"".</p>

<p>I have currently set up process (that works) that goes like this: </p>

<pre><code>Divide = 0;
RegEx check for AgentType1 in Charge Code: 
 Divide++;
 Set This-AgentType-Gets-Return; 
RegEx check for AgentType2 in Charge Code: 
 Devide++;
 Set This-AgentType-Gets-Return;
... etc ...
</code></pre>

<p>Then I divide the Amount by the ""Divide"" amount, and the result gets divvied up to each AgentType present in the Charge Code. </p>

<p>I know there must be an easier/simpler way to implement this, but it's not coming to me at the moment. </p>

<p>The webservice basically contains operations Start, Shutdown and GetCurrentState. </p>

<p>Start creates a COM component, Stop releases.
And GetCurrentState retrieves information from the COM component.</p>

<p>It seemed an easy thing, but after a day it still refuses to work.</p>

<p>I have tried storing the COM-reference as a member variable in the C# object. The object is constantly re-created.
Then I tried to store the COM-reference in the Session object. But still, something is still wrong.</p>

<p>So, I turned to the 2nd method, I wrote tag files. Then the above issue is solved. However, I then have problem getting a tag's parent tag, since I don't know the parent tag class. I could do the following if I wrote my own tag handler,</p>

<p>Do folks commonly test their persistence layer like this? Making sure that each field is persisted individually? I'm honestly not sure what best practice is for something like this. I can see testing something with long strings and parent/child relationships - but what about integers and dates? Is this overkill?</p>

<p>I'm just talking about the persistence layer here, not the business logic in the domain layer. For that, I would mock the repository, whereas here I'm verifying that the repository actually saved the thing that I told it to save. What if someone forgets to map a field, or they have a bogus string length in the mapping?</p>

<p>Are there any tools to automatically generate these kinds of tests in .NET? Or is that ""bad""?</p>

<pre><code>public void methodX (arg1, arg2) {
  Iterator&lt;String&gt; itr = clients.keySet().iterator;
  while (itr.hasNext()) {
    String name = itr.next();
    if (!""mod"".equals(name)) {
      try {
        clients.get(name).methodXX(arg1, arg2);
      } catch(RemoteException ex) {
        // do something
      }
    }
  }
}

public void methodY (arg1, arg2, arg3) {
  Iterator&lt;String&gt; itr = clients.keySet().iterator;
  while (itr.hasNext()) {
    String name = itr.next();
    if (!""mod"".equals(name)) {
      try {

      } catch(RemoteException ex) {
        // do something
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I modified these so that instead they each call a single method doAll by passing a new argument called MESSAGE_TYPE, like so:</p>

<pre><code>public void methodX (arg1, arg2) {
  doAll(MESSAGE_TYPE.METHODX, arg1, arg2, null);
}

public void methodY (arg1, arg2, arg3) {
  doAll(MESSAGE_TYPE_METHODY, arg1, arg2, arg3);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the doAll method:</p>

<pre><code>public void doAll(msg_type, arg1, arg2, arg3) {
 Iterator&lt;String&gt; itr = clients.keySet().iterator;
  while (itr.hasNext()) {
    String name = itr.next();
    if (!""mod"".equals(name)) {
      try {
        switch(msg_type) {
          case METHODX:
            clients.get(name).methodXX(arg1, arg2);
            break;
          case METHODY:
            clients.get(name).methodYY(arg1, arg2, arg3);

      } catch(RemoteException ex) {
        // do something
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now there are many more methods like this, and so my doAll method needs to take a bunch of args and each methodXX that calls it pass a bunch of nulls to it.</p>

"703382","1","","","2009-03-31 22:45:57","","2","938","<p>I am pretty new to ASP.NET MVC and I am trying to get my head around some of the design concepts at the moment. One thing I am currently stuck on is how (best) to handle a situation such as that described below.</p>

<p>Suppose I have a page that needs to render a number of ""sections"". For example, on the left hand side there is a list that is data driven and then the selected item in the list displays a further list in another section on the page. For better understanding lets suggest the left hand list is a list of movie categories and the other list displays a list of movies that are contained within that category, along with the various movie details.</p>

<p>Now, I have some form of ORM such as Entity Framework, LINQ to SQL or whatever that maps the tblCategory and tblMovie database tables into Category and Movie entities respectively. These entities live in the MyMVCApp.Data.Entities namespace. I then use a repository pattern located in the MyMVCApp.Data namespace to encapsulate the queries (via LINQ) against these entities to return our model entities.</p>

<p>This is where my first question lies. Should the repository be returning view model entities or domain entities which are then extended to produce view model entities? In my naive mind I see the entities returned from the ORM as simply containers for the data with domain entities containing the business logic. So surely there should be an abstration here?</p>

<p>Anyway, back to my scenario. Now lets assume I wish to present the two sections described at the beginning of this. I am assuming that what should be happening here is my domain entity model would contain a list of categories and their associated movies. So something like a List each of which contains a List. </p>

<p>This model would have been populated somewhere. This is my second question. Say my assumption above is correct and it is simply data entities are returned from the ORM. Now I have a namespace/project called MyMVCApp.Core.Model (or the like) with some domain entities such as the Movie and Category entities mentioned in the previous paragraph. Do these entities have methods on them to retrieve the data from the ORM and populate themselves? Or does the repository retrieve these populated entity models? And another question on this part, if I have a Movie and Customer entity in my ORM is it acceptable to be having domain entities named the same?</p>

<p>Finally, I assume the controller now has this populated list of Category and Movie objects and passes it back to the view. I am guessing it is best to have each of the sections described at the beginning as partial views and passing the populated model to each? So, it may be the IndexController which retrieves the populated CategoryMovies entity, passing this to the Categories partial view and the Movies partial view. I would then need to somehow determine the selected Category (quesrystring?) and display the appropriate list of Movies in that category within the view.</p>

<p>OK, so if anyone has got to this point in my ramblings I will take a deep bow. I hope I have explained my mixed up thoughts and questions in sufficient detail for someone to provide some kind of enlightenment.</p>

<p>There is no inheritance between any of them.
There's no real business logic involved, the objects are created, populated, and then accessed read-only, no further manipulations. </p>

<p>My natural coding style would be to go object oriented and write classes for each of those entities, use NSArrays for the lists, and have the mentioned properties synthesized.</p>

<p>But another approach seems obvious too: only use NSDictionaries and NSArrays, and working with keys/values instead of properties.

Another advantage is there's no additional custom encoding/decoding for serialization required (persisting state to disk, using JSON, ...)
So on the paper, it speaks for the latter approach, on the other hand, it still feels somehow awkward NOT to use custom objects... </p>

The example of using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern"" rel=""noreferrer"">factory method pattern</a> at Wikipedia describes the situation I'm in almost exactly:</p>

<pre><code>public class ImageReaderFactory 
{
    public static ImageReader getImageReader( InputStream is ) 
    {
        int imageType = figureOutImageType( is );

        switch( imageType ) 
        {
            case ImageReaderFactory.GIF:
                return new GifReader( is );
            case ImageReaderFactory.JPEG:
                return new JpegReader( is );
            // etc.
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, what does the <code>figureOutImageType</code> function look like?  In this specific example, I would assume that it checks a file header in the <code>InputStream</code> to determine which image format the data is in.  I would like to know if the <code>ImageReaderFactory</code> itself knows how to parse file headers and determine if the file type is GIF, JPEG, etc, or if it calls a function inside each <code>Reader</code> class that lets it know what type of image it is.  Something like this, maybe:</p>

<pre><code>int figureOutImageType(InputStream is)
{
    if(GifReader.isGIF(is))
        return ImageReaderFactory.GIF;
    else if(JpegReader.isJPEG(is))
        return ImageReaderFactory.JPEG;
    // etc.
}
</code></pre>

<p>It seems like having the factory know how to parse images breaks encapsulation, and letting the subclasses decide which one should be created is part of the factory method design pattern.  Yet, it also seems like the <code>figureOutImageType</code> function is just adding some redundant code, because why not just have each subclass perform its check on the <code>InputStream</code> in the <code>getImageReader</code> function and skip the switch case?  </p>

<p>I haven't had any experience using factories before, and I was hoping to get some insight from some people who have used them in the past on the best way to handle this problem.  Is it okay to have the factory know about the inner workings of its subclasses, or should they be responsible for letting the factory know which to create, and how do you organize it all?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

Using this interface you have to implement a method called <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.ialertnotifyhandler.onnotification.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OnNotification()</a>, which has the following signature:</p>

<pre><code>bool OnNotification (SPAlertHandlerParams ahp);

<p>At first I thought this meant that if you return <em>true</em> you signal SharePoint that your handler has done all alert processing and SharePoint shouldn't execute its default behaviour. However, in practice there doesn't seem to be any difference in the way the alerts are handled. You can return <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>, it doesn't make any difference.</p>

<p>and then somebody else pulls <code>master</code> from the my remote repository, what will they have to do to make everything point to the right place? Will I have to tell everybody to repeat my steps?</p>

<p>Is this akin to the problem of rebasing commits after pushing them and leaving other developers with dangling objects?</p>

<p>Consider a simple example:</p>

<pre><code>sequence = ['a', 'b', 'c']
list((el, ord(el)) for el in sequence)
</code></pre>

<p>This yields <code>[('a', 97), ('b', 98), ('c', 99)]</code> as expected.</p>

<p>Now, just swap the <code>ord(el)</code> out for an expression that takes the first value out of some generator using <code>(...).next()</code> — forgive the contrived example:</p>

<pre><code>def odd_integers_up_to_length(str):
    return (x for x in xrange(len(str)) if x%2==1)

list((el, odd_integers_up_to_length(el).next()) for el in sequence)
</code></pre>

<p>This yields <code>[]</code>. Yeah, empty list. No <code>('a',</code>stuff<code>)</code> tuples. Nothing.</p>

<p>But we're not filtering or aggregating or reducing. A generator expression over <code>n</code> objects without filtering or aggregation must yield <code>n</code> objects, right? What's going on?</p>

<p>The problem I am trying to solve is where I'm trying to do a custom scroll-to functionality on page load by detecting the anchor in the url, but so far have not been able to prevent the automatic scrolling functionality (specifically in Firefox).</p>

<p>Any ideas? I have tried preventDefault() on the $(window).load() handler, which did not seem to work.</p>

<p>Let me reiterate this is for links that are not clicked within the page that scrolls; it is for links that scroll on page load. Think of clicking on a link from another website with an #anchor in the link. What prevents that autoscroll to the id?</p>

<p>Everyone understand I'm not looking for a workaround; I need to know if (and how) it's possible to prevent autoscrolling to #anchors on page load.</p>

<h2><strong>NOTE</strong></h2>

<p>This isn't <em>really</em> an answer to the question, just a simple race-condition-style kluge.</p>

<p>Use jQuery's scrollTo plugin to scroll back to the top of the page, then reanimate the scroll using something custom. If the browser/computer is quick enough, there's no ""flash"" on the page.</p>

<p>I feel dirty just suggesting this...</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){

    // fix the url#id scrollto ""effect"" (that can't be
    // aborted apparently in FF), by scrolling back

<p>I'm working on a production system right now that seems to be slowing to a near halt on a daily basis, and no one can seem to figure out what is causing the issue.  This is your standard N-tier set up (client, web server, db server). I have created some simple ASP.NET pages that can do a few simple things that I'm using to establish a benchmark for stress testing that I can later user when comparing with the production system that is already in place.</p>

<p>I have already built a sample aspx page that simply returns back some web server statistics about the box utilizations, nothing heavy, maybe a few lines of code.  I've also created a simple web service (asmx) that will test a DB connection given the correct id, again nothing heavy just opening a db connection and a sample query that doesn't really do anything.</p>

<p>What I would like to know is, <strong><em>what is a good stress level that the following tests should operate under</em></strong>?  In particular, I'm using <strong>Microsoft's Web Application Stress Tool</strong>, and I'm curious what most people would expect the <strong>Stress Level</strong> and the <strong>Stress Multiplier</strong> <strong>acceptable</strong> ranges should be.  I already know at what point the web server starts buckling, its around 20 Stress Level and 10 Stress Multiplier give or take, which results in about ~275 page requests / sec.  I'm trying to find out if that number is way too low, and if that's some sort of indication that there's an issue between the client and the web server or a hardware issue of some sort, or if it's more of an indication that there's nothing wrong and that the system is just too heavy.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Since I originally wrote this post the code has been moved to a server running Windows 2003 utilizing IIS 7.</p>

<p>What I'd like to know now is if I set up a relatively simple test, such as a basic index.html file that just serves up a small page, what would you expect the ""best"" page requests / sec I could achieve from a stress test?</p>

I'd like to know how to call a web service which will take the lat and long values from my iPhone and feed them to a webservice so I can retrieve the City,State.

<p>Essentially, I only want ""City,State"" to be visible in a label on one of my views.</p>

<p>The first time I tried this was with geonames.org and it put my returned lat/lng location in the middle of nowhere many many many miles from where I actually was. I tried the same lat/lng values with google maps api and it was in the right place. The only problem I've had is parsing the JSON data back into my app. The returned info seems to have multiple versions of the same info which I can't seem to understand how that works.</p>

<p>So once again. Just looking for a simple HTTP style string I can pass somewhere with my lat/lng values and it returns ""City,State"". If the example you mention involves parsing data. Please refer to an example I can dissect - I'm a noob.</p>

<p>However to try and avoid this problem in the future I have created my own interface for injecting fields and properties (which will essentially call methods on the IOC container I wish to use within the current web application). So now my control library is independant of any particular IOC container which will speed up any changes in that area in the future.</p>

<p>I was wondering has anyone else has done the same thing?</p>

<p>I'm happy with what it has achieved but ideally I would like to update it. In my controls I create these injected fields often as protected and set them in the constructor for that control. </p>

{
    Inject(ref _blogService);

IEmailService _emailService = null;

<p>Has anyone got any ideas of how to neaten the code up or make it work in a cleaner way? I also would want to avoid attributes so it forces the developer to make a decision to inject the variable at a certain point within the control.</p>

<pre><code>void deleteForMe(int* pointer)
{
     delete[] pointer;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The pointer could be all sorts of different things, and so performing an unconditional <code>delete[]</code> on it is undefined. However, let's assume that we are indeed passing an array pointer,</p>

<pre><code>int main()
{
     int* arr = new int[5];
     deleteForMe(arr);
     return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, in this case where the pointer <strong>is</strong> an array, who is it that knows this? I mean, from the language/compiler's point of view, it has no idea whether or not <code>arr</code> is an array pointer versus a pointer to a single int. Heck, it doesn't even know whether <code>arr</code> was dynamically created. Yet, if I do the following instead,</p>

<pre><code>int main()
{
     int* num = new int(1);
     deleteForMe(num);
     return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The OS is smart enough to only delete one int and not go on some type of 'killing spree' by deleting the rest of the memory beyond that point (contrast that with <code>strlen</code> and a non-<code>\0</code>-terminated string -- it will keep going until it hits 0).</p>

<p>So whose job is it to remember these things? Does the OS keep some type of record in the background? (I mean, I realise that I started this post by saying that what happens is undefined, but the fact is, the 'killing spree' scenario doesn't happen, so therefore in the practical world <em>someone</em> is remembering.)</p>

<p>I need to generate a WCF proxy for a service exposed by our client. The service is locked down pretty tightly, so this is proving difficult. Also, I'm new to WCF, so I may be missing something obvious...<br/><br/></p>

<p>The client has only opened up their firewall to our production server - so I can't generate the proxy from Visual Studio on my dev machine. Also, the service is only exposed over HTTPS. And it requires us to authenticate using a client certificate...</p>

<p>I was hoping to run svcutil on the production box to generate the .cs files, and then copy the files locally. But svcutil refuses to run because the client is using a self-signed certificate. It gives me the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The underlying connection was closed:
  Could not establish trust relationship
  for the SSL/TLS secure channel. The
  remote certificate is invalid
  according to the validation procedure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried adding the service's certificate as a trusted root certificate, but that doesn't work. In the certificates MMC snap-in, I get ""Windows does not have enough information to verify the certificate"".</p>

<p>Is there some way to bypass the security check that svcutil is performing? <br/><br/></p>

<p>I can browse to the WSDL successfully from IE, when I'm remoted in to the production server. I just have to click ""continue to this website (not recommended)"". I also have to select the installed client cert, which works fine. I can then download the WSDL and XSD files manually through IE. So another alternative might be to generate the WCF proxy from local copies of the WSDL and XSD, instead of running svcutil against the live service. But I don't know how to do that properly. </p>

<p>I tried putting the static WSDL and XSD files up on another website that we host, and changing the &lt;xs:import schemaLocation=""...""/&gt; attributes to point to the new site. But when I ran svcutil against this site, I got a bunch of errors about duplicate type declarations - e.g.:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error: There was a validation error on
  a schema generated during export:

Am I missing some obvious way to do this? Or should we just demand that the client loosen up their security? :)<br/><br/></p>

<p>Certain server-side operations in the system are taking longer than 3 minutes.  Users consistently noticed that the Ajax call returns 503 error at the 3 minute mark.  My users can wait longer than 3 minutes, but 503 errors interrupt their work.</p>

<p>The current theory is that the 503 error is being raised by the IE XMLHttpRequest object.  A team of supposed WebLogic experts poured over our code and WebLogic logs, and declared that there's no timeout occurring on the server side.  But I have my doubts.</p>

<p>My question is, which piece of software is responsible for raising 503 error: the browser, the Ajax javascript, or the server?  And can this timeout period be changed?</p>

<p>When I run this code, NSStreamEventOpenCompleted and NSStreamEventErrorOccurred is called.The NSOutputStream's write method was called successfully and all the data is not nil. But after the data is written to the oStream, the eventCode will change to NSStreamEventErrorOccurred. </p>

<p>I'm only familiar with SVN and CVS which have a set list of keywords, but there would be applications for something like $LineNo$ or $MyLicenceText$. I'm sure there would be other use cases. The idea would be to create a plugin architecture where the behaviour of a keyword could be defined or modified.</p>

<p>So my question is - is there a tool (commerical or open source) that already has something  like that?</p>

<p>Edit: Doing it as a part of the build is a valid way of solving the problem, however would cause issues if a developer did not do a build prior to check-in. Imagine for something like $LineNo$, if the build was not in sync with the source exactly, the value could easily be incorrect. For keywords with more static behaviour though (like $MyLicenceText$) replacement on build is a valid solution.</p>

So what is all of the fuss about using a singleton to control the db connection in your web app? Some like it some hate it i don't understand it. From what I've read, ""it's to ensure that there is always only one active connection to your DB"". I mean why is that a good thing? 1 active DB connection on a data driven web app processing multiple requests per second spells trouble doesn't it? For whatever reason nobody can properly explain this. I've been all over the web. I know i'm thick.</p>

Not very pretty.  I was wondering how I could keep it collapsed through the loading process and only expand when clicked.</p>

<p>I am working with the standalone 1.6 version of the accordion plugin.</p>

<p>The basic structure :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""sidebar""&gt;
    &lt;ul id=""navigation"" class=""ui-accordion-container""&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=""head"" href=""#""&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;ul class=""sub""&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;2a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt; 
         &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the script</p>

<pre><code>jQuery().ready(function(){
    jQuery('#navigation').accordion({ 
        active: 'false', 
        header: '.head', 
        navigation: true,
        animated: 'easeslide',
        collapsible: true
    });     
});
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to hide the elements in the CSS to keep them from appearing while loading but all that achieved is in having them always hidden. </p>

<p>Maybe the problem is in the CSS I have a background image in each of the sub menus:</p>

<pre><code>#navigation{
    margin:0px;
    margin-left: 10px;
    padding:0px;
    text-indent:0px;
    font-size: 1.1em;
    width:200px;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    padding-bottom: 30px;
} 
#navigation ul{
    border-width:0px;
    margin:0px;
    padding:0px;
    text-indent:0px;
}
#navigation li{
    list-style:none outside none;
}
#navigation li ul{
    height:185px; overflow:auto;
}
#navigation li ul.sub{
    background:url('../images/sub.jpg') no-repeat;
    dispaly: block;
}
#navigation li li a{
    color:#000000;
    display:block;
    text-indent:20px;
    text-decoration: none;
    padding: 6px 0;
}
#navigation li li a:hover{
    background-color:#FFFF99;
    color:#FF0000;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks in advance for any advice on how to have this thing run a little smoother and having the accordion always collapsed.</p>

<p>-edit - I forgot to mention that I am also hoping for a solution that will allow the nav to still be accessible for those without Javascript.  </p>

<p>First of all, the AIR app doesn't run from with the Flash IDE. There is no document class and when I place a trace statement on the first frame it never actually traces (yes, Omit trace actions in the publish settings is un-ticked). I see an application window (with an AIR icon) but it's not actually doing anything. It is as if the code is never executed.</p>

<p>Second, I'm not sure what should be included in the AIR package. It currently tries to package up all my source code when I create an AIR file, including my .svn folders.</p>

<p>It seems to be impossible to use relative paths in either the dialog that Flash presents (under the Controls menu) or a separate descriptor file. From Flash's point of view, what is the relative path anyway, where the Fla is placed or where the swf is placed? (currently different folders in my project).</p>

<p>The problem is that <code>in_degree</code> and <code>betweenness_centrality</code> are measured on different scales, say 0-15 vs 0-35000 and follow a power law distribution (at least definitely not the normal distribution)</p>

<p>Three obvious approaches are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standardizing the variables (subtract <code>mean</code> and divide by <code>stddev</code>). This seems it would squash the distribution too much, hiding the massive difference between a value in the long tail and one near the peak.</li>
<li>Re-scaling variables to the range [0,1] by subtracting <code>min(variable)</code> and dividing by <code>max(variable)</code>. This seems closer to fixing the problem since it won't change the shape of the distribution, but maybe it won't really address the issue?  In particular the means will be different.</li>
<li>Equalize the means by dividing each value by <code>mean(variable)</code>. This won't address the difference in scales, but perhaps the mean values are more important for the comparison?</li>

<p>However my code isn't even executing the alert(""Index: ""+i). Am I binding it correctly?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){

            $(this).click(function() {

                function(data) {
                    $('#rate_box a').each(function(i) {
                        $(this).unbind('click');
                    }

</code></pre>

<p>In response to a grid Command (insert/update/delete), a method called GetRowControls is called which iterates through the columns in the particular gridrow, and adds each of its controls to a Dictionary.</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;string, WebControl&gt; GetRowControls(GridViewRow row)
...

rowControls.Add(ctrl.ID, (WebControl)ctrl);

...
</code></pre>

<p>So this works fine for both template field and bound controls added declaratively, as well as dynamic-non template fields added programatically. </p>

<p>However when the control is a TemplateField control added dynamically ctrl.ID is always null and therefore the statement above throws an exception. </p>

<p>I've looked into this with Reflector because I found that when I examined the variable in the immediate window in VS 2005 i.e. ?ctrl, ctrl.ID WOULD list a value. I've since established that this is because in listing ?ctrl in the immediate window, the proprty ClientID is called and ClientID calls EnsureId(), which in turn sets ID.</p>

<pre><code>public virtual string ClientID
{
    get
    {
        this.EnsureID();
        string uniqueID = this.UniqueID;
        if ((uniqueID != null) &amp;&amp; (uniqueID.IndexOf(this.IdSeparator) &gt;= 0))
        {
            return uniqueID.Replace(this.IdSeparator, '_');
        }
        return uniqueID;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I'm assuming that ClientID, UniqueId and ID are all null - although as above just reading the first two will trigger all to be set. Also note that NamingContainer is not null. It has been set.</p>

<p>So the work around for this is quite simple i.e. check for ctrl.ID==null and if so simply read ctrl.ClientID. And thats what I've done because time wise I've really got to get a wriggle on. But I'm still interested in the answer if anyone knows it off the top of their heads.</p>

<p>Why is the ID value of a child control, of a dynamically added TemplateField, set at a different time from that of other controls?</p>

<p>which I need to store in a relational database.</p>

<p>My query relates to the two fields, <code>measurements1</code> and <code>measurements2</code>. Obviously, they are the same type, so my first thought was ""let's create a <code>SUB_DATA</code> table and create a Foreign Key link between them"". </p>

<pre><code>Table: ALL_THE_DATA
Field: ID (int, Primary Key)
Field: aNumber (int)
Field: aDouble (double)
Field: measurements1 (int, Foreign Key referencing SUB_DATA)
Field: measurements2 (int, Foreign Key referincing SUB_DATA)

Field: ID (int, Primary Key)
Field: measuredValue (double)
Field: standardDeviation (double)
Field: calculatedValue (double)
Field: weightedError (double)

<p>However, the actual context of the data is such that <code>measurements1</code> and <code>measurements2</code> are measurements of different things (let's say, apples and <strike>oranges</strike> rockets), which both happen to need a measured value, standard deviation, etc. Is it still appropriate, then, to store the data for measured apples and measured rockets in the same table, even though they use the same data, or would it be more prudent to design it so that rockets and apples have their own (identically-designed) tables?</p>

<pre><code>Table: ALL_THE_DATA
Field: ID (int, Primary Key)
Field: aNumber (int)
Field: aDouble (double)
Field: appleMeasurements (int, Foreign Key referencing APPLE_MEASUREMENTS)
Field: rocketMeasurements (int, Foreign Key referencing ROCKET_MEASUREMENTS)

Table: APPLE_MEASUREMENTS
Field: ID (int, Primary Key)
Field: measuredValue (double)
Field: standardDeviation (double)
Field: calculatedValue (double)
Field: weightedError (double)

Table: ROCKET_MEASUREMENTS
Field: ID (int, Primary Key)
Field: measuredValue (double)
Field: standardDeviation (double)
Field: calculatedValue (double)
Field: weightedError (double)

<p>Which of these two solutions is best, do you think? The first seems less redundant, but may have greater potential for there being inconsistent data. Or perhaps is there a better way to solve this problem than I've thought of?</p>

<p>(Please excuse my Apples/Rockets pseudodata - I can't really post actual code here)</p>

<p><strong>Extra Information:</strong><br/>
In this case, we can be certain that rockets and apples will not change their fields later, so I'm not too worried about the case of ""what if the fields in either rocket or apple change later"".</p>

The last two months I've been keeping track of these times more regularly than usual, and I happened to notice that on the day of the equinox the sunrise time jumped eight minutes as compared to the day before!  I knew this was impossible and compared with <a href=""http://aa.usno.navy.mil"" rel=""noreferrer"">NOAA</a>, finding out that my rise and set times had been off for several days and in fact seemed to be off by about a minute for most of the year.</p>

<p>At this point, I'd like to just implement the calculations myself.  What algorithms or formulas are available to do this computation?</p>

Wikipedia gives these computed out to the minute, so something more exact must be possible.  Libraries for my favorite programming language also come out to those hardcoded times, so I assume they are using the same or a similar algorithm as the one I implemented.</p>

<p>I also once tried using a library that gave me the solar longitude and implementing a search routine to zero in on the exact moments of 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees; this worked down to the second but did not agree with the times in Wikipedia, so I assume there was something wrong with this approach.  I am, however, pleasantly surprised to discover that Maimonides (medieval Jewish scholar) proposed an algorithm using the exact same idea a millenium ago.</p>

<p>As a example I have the following class structures:</p>

<pre><code>public class Adaptee
{
    private Adaptee() { }

    public int MyProperty { get; set; }

    public static Adaptee New()
    {
        return new Adaptee();
    }
}

public class Target
{
    public int MyProperty { get; set; }
}

public class Adapter : Target
{
    public Adapter(Adaptee adaptee)
    {
        this.MyProperty = adaptee.MyProperty;
    }
}

public class MyTestClass
{
    public Target MyTarget { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the Adaptee is not under my control and it has no public constructor, hence the use of the adapter. So Adaptee gets created as follow</p>

<pre><code>Adaptee adaptee = Adaptee.New();
adaptee.MyProperty = 5;
</code></pre>

<p>In the actual code the above code would be executed in a externally controlled assembly and then passed to the following code:</p>

<pre><code>using (UnityContainer container = new UnityContainer())
{
    container
        .RegisterType&lt;MyTestClass&gt;(
            new InjectionProperty(""MyTarget""));

    container.RegisterInstance&lt;Adaptee&gt;(adaptee, new ExternallyControlledLifetimeManager());

    MyTestClass myTestClass = container.Resolve&lt;MyTestClass&gt;();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would like the execution of the code to result in the following:</p>

<pre><code>Debug.Assert(myTestClass != null);
Debug.Assert(myTestClass.MyTarget != null);
Debug.Assert(myTestClass.MyTarget.MyProperty == adaptee.MyProperty);
</code></pre>

<p>This means that a resolved instance of Adapter should be injected into the MyTarget property of the myTestClass instance. The instance of Adapter should have been created with externally created instance of Adaptee.</p>

<p>The following code:</p>

<pre><code>container
    .RegisterType&lt;MyTestClass&gt;(
        new InjectionProperty(""MyTarget""));
</code></pre>

<p>should actually result in this:</p>

<pre><code>container
    .RegisterType&lt;MyTestClass&gt;(
        new InjectionProperty(""MyTarget"", container.Resolve&lt;Adapter&gt;()));
</code></pre>

<p>This does not seem to be possible, since no instance of Adapter exist yet and it has a private constructor.</p>

Do you catch return code from 3rd party API/standard library/any other library, and not just the functions that you implement?

I tried using SQL Server Express, but loading the information, even with BULK import takes a very long time, and ideally I need to have the entire data set in memory, to reduce hard disk IO.</p>

<p>There are over 120,000,000 records, but even when I attempt to filter the information to just one column (in-memory), my C# console application is consuming ~3.5GB of memory to process just 125MB (700MB actually read-in) of text.</p>

<p>It seems that the references to the strings and string arrays are not being collected by the GC, even after setting all references to null and encapsulating IDisposables with the using keyword.</p>

<p>I think the culprit is the String.Split() method which is creating a new string for each comma separated value.</p>

<p>You may suggest that I shouldn't even read the unneeded* columns into a string array, but that misses the point: How can I place this <em>entire</em> data set in memory, so I can process it in parallel in C#?</p>

<p>I could optimize the statistical algorithms and coordinate tasks with a sophisticated scheduling algorithm, but this is something I was hoping to do before I ran into memory problems, and not because of.</p>

<p>I have included a full console application that simulates my environment and should help replicate the problem.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Under title"" <em>Retrieving data from threads</em> MSDN (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ts553s52(VS.71).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here</a>) introduces a way to get data from a child thread by using callback method which is encapsulated by a delegate passed from main thread to the child thread - who has the data.</p>

<p>You can see that clearly ( the last Example in the MSDN <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ts553s52(VS.71).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">page</a>)</p>

<p>My Q is, since we are taking about retrieving data  (from child threads to main thread) the call back method should be executed by the main thread and not by the child thread...</p>

<p>I changed the code a bit ( to verify that) so I attached the name of the thread before each output:</p>

<pre><code> public static void ResultCallback(int lineCount) {
    Console.WriteLine(Thread.CurrentThread.Name + "":Independent task printed {0} lines."", lineCount);  
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I named the child thread: ""Method2"" while the main thread ""System""...</p>

<p>I got this output: <strong>Method2</strong>: Independent task printed 1 lines. </p>

<p>where the correct output should have been : <strong>System</strong>:Independent task printed 1 lines..</p>

<p>now I hava a data bound control (i.e. ItemsControl or DataGrid), that is created dynamically.

"704464","1","704511","","2009-04-01 07:47:49","","1","158","<p>The problem I have is this:</p>

<p>I have a table (just an example) with the following fields:</p>

<pre><code>ID int
Value int
</code></pre>

<p>I have a method called IncreaseByFive() which does the following:</p>

<pre><code>method IncreaseByFive(int ID)
{    
    int value = GetValueFromDB(ID);
    value = value + 5;
    SaveValueToDB(value, ID);    
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I want to avoid is the following situation:</p>

<ol>
<li>User A calls method and gets the value (currently 5)</li>
<li>User B calls method and gets the value (currently 5)</li>
<li>User A increases value by 5 (now 10)</li>
<li>User B increases value by 5 (now 10)</li>
<li>User A saves value (10)</li>
<li>User B saves value (10)</li>
</ol>

<p>Now the record has a value of 10 when it should have been 15.</p>

<p>What I want to force is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>User A calls method and gets the value (currently 5)</li>
<li>User B calls method but has to wait because A already called it. (Dibs!)</li>
<li>User A increases the value (now 10)</li>
<li>User B is still waiting</li>
<li>User A saves the value (record has value of 10)</li>
<li>User B can now read the value (10)</li>
<li>User B increases the value (15)</li>
<li>User B saves the value</li>
</ol>

<p>Now the record has a value of 15, which is the outcome I'm looking for.</p>

<p>I've solved this problem in the past using a static class and putting a lock on a static object created within the constructor of that class, thus funneling all the work through one static method, which forces other calls to wait in line. I'm afraid however that this isn't scalable.</p>

<p>I also think that the the highest isolation level (serializable) for a transaction won't do the trick either because it will allow the read in step 2 of the unwanted example above.</p>

<p>I suppose another solution would be to create my own lock table and record the locks there, but that seems like it shouldn't be neccessary.</p>

<p>I'm developing this project with C# (3.5) and SQL server 2008.</p>

The addin works just fine on my machine (HP NC6320 laptop, 3gb RAM T5600 1.8ghz Core2 cpu), however when it is tested on another users machine (HP nc6710b laptop 2gb RAM, T7200 2ghz Core2 cpu), it is substantially slower. I've also tried it on another laptop the same type as mine, and it is also fast</p>

<p>I've been through the obvious things, like applications running, Antivirus stuff, etc. The machines are both fully patched, and up to date.</p>

<p>Basically, what the addin does is:
1.  Read data from a SQL Server 2005 database
2.  Do some manipulation on it
3.  Display it on a worksheet, and format it appropriately</p>

<p>The slow bit is the displaying on the worksheet.</p>

<p>I'm stumped as to why it would be slower on a newer machine.. Just to really confuse myself, I tried it on a VM (VMware Workstation v6.5) with 256mb RAM, and 1 cpu, running xp and only Office 2003 installed on it, and it was substantially quicker than the new laptop.</p>

<p>So in summary, an Excel Addin performs quickly on a low spec VM, and on an older laptop, but on a newer spec laptop it is slower.</p>

<p>I am looking for ways to demonstrate to an Excel user (with no programming experience) how learning some Excel VBA can make their life working with Excel a little easier.</p>

<p>First thoughts are to use an example that replicates manual tweaking of a spreadsheet, such as one click conditional formatting of all the data.  For example: highlighting all the numbers red, orange or green according to user input thresholds coupled with some other derived data such as current business week.</p>

<p>I am hoping that such a short VBA example should not be too difficult to grasp for someone who has never written a line of code before, and hopefully make a case for trying to learn a bit of Excel VBA.</p>

<p>However, with this example the time taken to code it is not significantly quicker than applying the conditional formatting manually in Excel.  So I would be interested to know if anyone in the community has any more elegant examples that demonstrate the advantages of using Excel VBA.</p>

<p>Ideal examples would have the following characteristics:</p>

<ol>
<li>Significant time savings (large T, where T = time for manual procedure / time to code).</li>
<li>Non-abstract, everyday spreadsheet examples.</li>
<li>End results that can not be <i>easily</i> achieved manually.</li>
<li>Achievable with short, basic VBA code.</li>
</ol>

<p>Bear in mind that the target audience is taking their first steps into programming.</p>

You could then use RESTORE FROM, load the stored memory and re-enact the event in all it's gory detail and start debugging.

<p>I remember to have read something about IO completions in the help entry for QueueUserWorkItem (the WinAPI function used in the thread pool implementation), but I couldn't understand it properly. I used WT_EXECUTELONGFUNCTION for my worker threads since execution can take a while and I want a new worker thread created instead of waiting for the existing ones to finish. Some of the tasks assigned to the worker threads perform some I/O stuff. I tried to use WT_EXECUTEINIOTHREAD but it does not seem to help.</p>

<p>I should mention that the main thread waits for entry to a critical section witht the call stack being</p>

<pre><code>System.Halt0, System.FinalizeUnits, Classes.Finalization, TThread.Destroy,
RtlEnterCriticalSection, RtlpWaitForCriticalSection
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas what I'm doing wrong here? Thanks for your help in advance.</p>

<p>I have an update() method (<a href=""http://mywebsite/post?update"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://mywebsite/post?update</a>) that updates the database and then if it's successful it forwards to the same action class but I used a different method to handle it, the list() method (<a href=""http://mywebsite/post?list"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://mywebsite/post?list</a>) which lists all the posts of the current user. The problem is it doesn't work and throws up a:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>javax.servlet.ServletException: </p>
  
  <p>The server side component of the HTTP

<p>Do you guys have any idea on how to fix this? Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>EDIT: I solved it guys. I just need to put value in the parameter of my forward, in my case I have to do: post?list=list instead of just post?list (the normal way). The method is ignored I guess if it doesn't have a value. It's really weird why Struts is behaving like this. Maybe someone can shed some light on this?</p>

"704649","1","","","2009-04-01 08:51:40","","22","4006","<p>I'm currently trying to get OpenVG up and running on my desktop. The problem comes here: I am / will be developing an application for a Windows CE device (with .NET compact framework), which has hardware-accelerated OpenGL ES 2.0 and OpenVG 1.0.1 (based on TI OMAP35x, if you're interested). The application will definitely use OpenVG for drawing, and likely OpenGL for some effects if OpenVG doesn't offer them (i.e. blur).</p>

<p>Now I'd like to develop on my desktop without the emulator (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/653577/debug-net-compact-framework-app-locally-without-emulator-or-device"">this question</a>). So I thought I just import OpenVG with P/Invoke, which was quite easy, since the OpenVG people made their constants into real enums, and though a procedural C API, it translated very well into an object-oriented form (with a Graphics class for drawing and Path, Paint, Stroke and Image objects). I also managed to get going with <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/654089/dllimport-with-different-entry-points-different-dlls-for-the-same-import-in-diff"">differently named DLLs and entry points</a>. Oh, and I imported EGL 1.3, also quite easy to translate to an object-oriented API.</p>

<p>Until this point, it sounded quite good. I thought I'd just use the OpenVG reference implementation from Khronos, but it is slow. Really slow. You know, like clearing the surface taking literally a <em>second</em>! So I thought, fine, OpenVG is a standard, I'll just take one of the other implementations. Most of them are based on OpenGL, which is what I want. Or isn't it?</p>

<p>No, it's not. Creating an OpenGL ES 2.0 surface with EGL 1.3 (supplied with the PowerVR Windows Emulation SDK for OpenGL ES 2.0) is not compatible with any OpenVG implementation I tried. Some of them require traditional OpenGL (AmanithVG GLE), the EGL version supplied by PowerVR doesn't support OpenVG. Most implementations don't even have EGL and use some bizarre functions to initialize the context - all of them assuming that an OpenGL context has already been created. OpenGL, not OpenGL ES. Sigh.</p>

<p>The only one I could get to work was AmanithVG SRE, which is very fast for a software implementation and does not rely on OpenGL or EGL. It works, but it is still far too slow for real time animations.</p>

<p>I can't believe that these things feel so wrong. I'm really tempted to just use WindowsMobile.DirectX.Direct3D, for which PowerVR supplies an emulation layer for Desktop Windows, in the hope that the final Board Support Package will supply Direct3D as an OpenGL ES wrapper, like it seems to be on many devices.</p>

<p>So, the question, finally:</p>

<p>Is there any OpenVG implementation for Windows Desktop systems that works with OpenGL ES 2.0? Bonus points if it works smoothly with PowerVR's OpenGL ES 2.0 emulation and the supplied EGL 1.3.</p>

<p>Or should I just try to use a traditional OpenGL 2.0 implementation on the Desktop? But they're typically not supplying EGL as well. I don't want to have two initialization layers (EGL and WGL). Or should I?</p>

<p>Note: this is not a .NET question, because the problem is the very same without .NET.</p>

<p>MYDOMAIN is the true domain name of our main site, NEWDOMAIN is a perfectly valid DNS entry which points to the same site.</p>

<p>I don't think this can be a browser issue as the actual rendered source code (viewed via view source) has been changed.  Checked in both IE7/8 and Firefox 3 and witnessed same behaviour.</p>

<p><strong><em>Original Question</em></strong></p>

<p>I have an ASP.Net 2.0 application which has several master pages.  This is essentially mocked up to look exactly like our main website, but because it runs on a different server all of the URLs for menu items etc are given absolute URLs to our main site.</p>

<p>This works fine on my development machine, but on the production server all of the URLs which are absolute are changing at runtime, but they still end up at the same pages when clicked.</p>

<p>Is this a DNS issue?  Does ASP.Net do some DNS resoltion of URL's when the master page and content are merged?  If so then why does it not have the same effect on my local machine, they are on the same domain.</p>

<p>I've got a module called Loader.bas, that I use to do most of the donkey work (loading and unloading any other modules that are required) - and I'd like to be able to load it up from a file as soon as the spreadsheet is opened.</p>

<p>I've attached the following code to the Workbook_Open event (in the ThisWorkbook class).</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub Workbook_Open()
    Call RemoveLoader
    Call LoadLoader
End Sub

<p>Where RemoveLoader (also within the ThisWorkbook class) contains the following code:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub RemoveLoader()
    Dim y As Integer
    Dim OldModules, NumModules As Integer
    Dim CompName As String

    With ThisWorkbook.VBProject
        NumModules = ThisWorkbook.VBProject.VBComponents.Count
        y = 1
        While y &lt;= NumModules
            If .VBComponents.Item(y).Type = 1 Then
                CompName = .VBComponents.Item(y).Name

    End With
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Which is probably a bit overcomplicated and slightly crude - but I'm trying everything I can find to get it to load the external module!</p>

<p>Often, when I open the spreadsheet, the RemoveLoader function finds that there's a ""Loader1"" module already included in the VBA project that it is unable to remove, and it also fails to load the new Loader module from the file.</p>

<p>Any ideas if what I'm trying to do is possible? Excel seems very fond of appending a 1 to these module names - either when loading or removing (I'm not sure which).</p>

<code>bool decompress_rgb(unsigned char *data, long dataLen, int scale)
float* getRgbBuffer()</code></pre>

<p>The first function is working fine. I can tell by putting some debug code in the shared library and checking the input.</p>

<p>The problem is getting the data out. The RGB buffer is a pointer to a float (obviously) and this pointer stays constant during the life of the application. Therefore whenever I want to decompress an image, I call <code>decompress_rgb</code> and then need to see what's at the location pointed to by <code>getRgbBuffer</code>. I know that the buffer size is (720 * 288 * sizeof(float)) so I guess this has to come into play somewhere.</p>

<p>There's no <code>c_float_p</code> type so I thought I'd try this:</p>

<pre><code>getRgbBuffer.restype = c_char_p</code></pre>

<p>Then I do:</p>

<pre><code>ptr = getRgbBuffer()
print ""ptr is "", ptr</code></pre>

<p>which just outputs:</p>

<pre><code>ptr = 3078746120</code></pre>

<p>I'm guessing that's the actual address rather than the content, but even if I was successfully dereferencing the pointer and getting the contents, it would only be the first char.</p>

<p>How can I get the contents of the entire buffer into a python string? </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Had to change:</p>

<pre><code>getRgbBuffer.restype = c_char_p</code></pre>

The purpose is to use it with jQuery.ui sortable. </p>

<p>Everything is working fine, in fact I can even get the cloning and the appending right. However, it appends it <b>before</b> the closing <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> tag, and for the life of me I can't force it to append <b>after</b> this tag.</p>

<p>This is the HTML Markup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id=""column-2"" class=""connectedSortable""&gt;
    &lt;li class=""ui-state-default""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""label""&gt;feature&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=""action""&gt;
            &lt;div class=""delete""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=""other""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The part we're concerned with is <code>class=""other""</code> which upon being clicked on will duplicate the list item.</p>

<p>This is the jQuery so far:</p>

<pre><code>// This works fine
$("".other"").click(function() {

    // This needs to be set (global) to be used later on in some future code.
    actionTarget = this;        

    // This grabs the whole list item
    var targetStory = $(actionTarget).parent().parent();

    // This clones the list item, as well as appending 
    // that clone to the cloned list item
    $(targetStory).clone().appendTo(targetStory);

})
</code></pre>

<p>This works well, it grabs the list item, clones it, then dumps it on the screen - but in the wrong place :(</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id=""column-2"" class=""connectedSortable""&gt;
    &lt;li class=""ui-state-default""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""label""&gt;feature&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=""action""&gt;

<p>I'll give an example where I don't understand how UserControls fit into the pattern.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a UserControl that shows the
  latest tags (much like on
  StackOverflow). Unlike StackOverflow I
  want to display this UserControl on
  all of my pages. If  I have a
  controller say QuestionController
  which is meant to handle actions from
  some question views e.g. view and
  detail, does this mean I have to fetch
  the data in the QuestionController and
  then pass it to the UserControl?</p>
  
  <p>If I create another controller say
  SearchController then I would have to
  replicate the same functionality to
  get the latest tags to pass to a
  partial again. Doesn't this mean that
  the 2 different controllers are doing
  extra things that they weren't
  originally intended to do?</p>

I have several classes which are all based on parsing a string inside the constructor.
The parsing is done in a static method which creates list of key value pairs and is common for all classes, but some fields are also common for all classes - thus I use a abstract template class.</p>

<p>The problem is that I do not see a way to inherite the implementation of the constructor of the abstract base class. Otherwise I would implement the constructor strategy in the base class and  would force the handling of the lists inside some abstract methods.</p>

<p>Edit:
Added Not working code for the template class</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class XXXMessageTemplate 
{
    public XXXMessageTemplate(string x) // implementation for the constructor 
   {
       Parse(x);//general parse function
       CommonFields();//filling common properties
       HandlePrivateProperties();//fill individual properties
       HandlePrivateStructures();//fill individual structures
    }
    abstract void HandlePrivateProperties();
    abstract void HandlePrivateStructures();

The actual messages should not implement any constructor and only implement the HandlePrivateProperties and HandlePrivateStructures functions.

<p>This works fine in un-marshalled code (same <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms693344"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">thread apartment</a>) but if a marshaller is involved is it smart enough to only set the return value if the function succeeded?</p>

<p>Create some test objects (TTestCase or whatever) at runtime, say 10 of them, where each one</p>

<ol>
<li>Is named at run time from a randomly generated integer. (By 'name' I mean the name of the test that appears in the test-runner tree.)</li>
<li>Passes or fails based on a random integer. Pass for even, fail for odd.</li>
</ol>

<p>From the design of DUnit, it <em>looks</em> like it was designed with enough flexibility in mind to make such things possible. I'm not sure that it is though. I tried to create my own test class by inheriting from TAbstractTest and ITest, but some crucial methods weren't accessible. I also tried inheriting from TTestCase, but that class is closely tied to the idea of running published methods (and the tests are named after the methods, so I couldn't just have a single one called, say, 'go', because then all my tests would be called 'go', and I want all my tests to be individually named).</p>

<p>Or alternatively, is there some alternative to DUnit that could do what I want?</p>

<ul>
<li>The user enters an ISBN code</li>
<li>If the ISBN is valid, check whether it exists,</li>
<li>If it's valid and it exists, show book details and enable save button, if not, show 'add book'-button,</li>
<li>If it's not valid, show error,</li>
<li>Eventually, the user will click 'save', so the entry will have to be saved.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's four responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Validate ISBN,</li>
<li>Check book existence,</li>
<li>Show book details,</li>
<li>Save new book details.</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is: Should I keep the application logic in one MVP-structure or should I split it into four MVP-structures, one for each responsibility?</p>

<p>Keeping it in one MVP-structure would</p>

<ul>
<li>make the model more complicated</li>
<li>make the tests setup more complicated (lots of setup code for each test to choose the right validator,returned book etc. even if they're not used),</li>
<li>make the presentation logic easier to follow</li>
</ul>

<p>Keeping it in separate MVP-structures would</p>

<ul>
<li>make the model simpler,</li>
<li>create more but simpler tests for each presenter,</li>
<li>put complexity in the interactions between the presenters (how would I signal a presenter that an ISBN is valid so that book details can be shown?)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm trying for the Presenter First-principles, so:
- Keep the view dumb (so no events like ""Presenter one validated the ISBN""),
- Keep the presenters stateless,
- Keep the models simple (enough)</p>

<p>Anyone has an idea on what's the best way to do this?</p>

<p>but I'm not that up on generics.</p>

<p>My motivations are: 1) it would make more sense to me for my program for this to be part of the type and not be involved with the constructor (which has other more relevant things to do) and 2) I'm trying to learn generics.</p>

One of the configurable features it has is if csc.exe is available for the final executable.  The documentation for it says that it's typically only needed if using XML serialization (I am).  I've modified my build process to use SGen to create the serialization assembly, and added the result to the references of each project in the solution that uses my xml classes.  The serialization classes are making it into the linked .net executable (all .net dlls combined into a single managed exe); so I assume I have that configured properly.  </p>

<p>However my app still attempts to execute csc when it runs.  Am I doing something wrong with the serialization assembly, resulting in it being recreated at runtime; or is my app doing something else that requires csc, and how do I determine what?</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/134224/generating-an-xml-serialization-assembly-as-part-of-my-build"">Generating an Xml Serialization assembly as part of my build</a></p>

<p>Edit:  Done some testing with a modified app.config to keep the serialization files visible if generated (tested by undoing the build time generation); and it appears that I did have them properly created before.  Unless there's a different part of the framework that invokes csc at runtime and which has its results unhidden using a different flag I think the RemoteSoft tool is probably to blame.  I can't be certain though because the output executable doesn't leave any temps it creates visible even if the app.config file it injested told it to.</p>

<p>The app.info I used was this.  Elsewhere I saw examples using a value of 4, but haven't been able to find any difference between their behavior.</p>

<p>The code implements a display tree for use in a 3d graphics app. It is a linked list of entries which have a type field specifying whether the entry is a window, geometry feature or light etc. In particular geometry features can either be a single piece of geometry of a collection of sub features, which is indicated by the presence of a separate structure. </p>

<p>Being a linked list it is a flat structure but the order implies hierarchy. Also, each entry has an attribute structure which is able to be propagated down the list. </p>

<p>A separate function allows this list to be traversed and a provided function pointer to be executed on traversal of the list. Each function used in this way must take proper care to maintain the attribute structure as it is propagated down the list and this is a frequent cause of rendering bugs (usually things not realising they should be redrawn because they are part of a group of entries, for example)</p>

<p>While some aspects of OO design jump right out at me I am interested to hear:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>how i would best implement being able to pass a function pointer down a list (or vector - are STL vectors ok for lists like this?)</p></li>
<li><p>whether i would be right to implement windows and geometry features as related (or even the same) classes </p></li>
<li><p>how to best design a class that can have a collection of itself</p></li>

<p>If I connect to the remote server with no options other than <code>-connect</code>, OpenSSL sends an SSLv2 CLIENT-HELLO, the server responds with a TLSv1 ServerHello, and everything proceeds normally.</p>

<p>If I connect with <code>-ssl3</code>, OpenSSL sends an SSLv3 ClientHello, the server responds with an SSLv3 ServerHello, and again everything is fine.</p>

<p>However, if I connect with <code>-no_ssl2</code> or <code>-tls1</code>, OpenSSL sends a TLSv1 ClientHello, and the server responds with <code>""TLS 1.0 Alert [length 0002], fatal unexpected_message""</code>, which is the original problem I was seeing in my application.</p>

<p>There are a number of possible workarounds that suggest themselves at this point, but I'm ideally looking for something generic, rather than special-casing this particular server, so I'm hoping there's some kind of ""standard"" workaround for this.</p>

I recently started playing with jQuery and came across a tutorial on how to do <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Edit_in_Place_with_Ajax"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Edit in Place</a> on a form.</p>

<p>The resulting code works perfectly if you hard-code the id of your container div in the function, but I'm having issues generalizing it for an id passed in to the function.</p>

<p>The code starts like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    setClickable($('#editInPlace'));
});

function setClickable(target)
{
    $(target).click
    (
        function()
        {
            //Do some dom manipulation

            $('.buttonA').click(function() { saveChanges(this, false); });
            $('.buttonB').click(function() { saveChanges(this, true); });
        }
    )

    .mouseover(function() { $(this).addClass(""editable""); })
    .mouseout(function() { $(this).removeClass(""editable""); });
}; //end of function setClickable

function saveChanges(obj, cancel)
{
    //Handle the save changes code

    //Reset the div
    $(obj).parent().after('&lt;div id=""editInPlace""&gt;' + t + '&lt;/div&gt;').remove();

    //Call setClickable
    setClickable($('#editInPlace'));
}
</code></pre>

<p>The part I'm having issues with is the last call to <code>setClickable</code> inside of the <code>saveChanges</code> function.  If I hard-code the value of <code>$('#editInPlace')</code>, it works fine.  However, if I change the function signature to </p>

<pre><code>function saveChanges(target, obj, cancel)
</code></pre>

<p>and pass in the target object from the setClickable method:</p>

<pre><code>$('.buttonB').click(function() { saveChanges(target, this, true); });
</code></pre>

<p>calling </p>

<pre><code>setClickable(target);
</code></pre>

<p>doesn't seem to work and I can't figure out why.</p>

I'm hoping that a lot of other people have also used this plugin, hence me requiring some help with regards to using it along with ASP.NET.</p>

<p>I have however run into a problem with it in the past and trying to get it working with ASP.NET server controls - basically one cannot use any server controls within the modal as it creates another form tag, and as you obviously know, ASP.NET only allows ONE form tag.  So I have decided to use standard HTML controls instead and call server-side code (say on button click) using web-services/page-methods.  This is fine, but what I don't understand is how to do a proper callback in the modal, in other words - click the button, the modal shrinks to its default size and shows the loading indicator, and then enlarges when the HTML response has been received, and hopefully show the status of the request (ie. <em>successful</em> or <em>failed</em>)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>has anyone experienced any similar problems with IE8?</strong></li>
<li>I've determined that it actually fires the onMouseDownCommand command</li>
<li>also the CSS of the button area is different in IE8, it doesn't have color shading that it does in IE7. I can imagine that somewhere the HTML is not valid and IE8 being stricter is not playing along, but where?</li>

<h1>ANSWER:</h1>

<p>Turned out to be that the application was not checking the navigator.agent for ""MSIE 8.0"" and was thus treating IE8 has a non-Internet-Explorer browser.</p>

<p>To make it clear,the loop is executed only one time due to the short length of the bytes passed(4).</p>

<p>Only one call is executed from this huge code(only once),the call is:</p>

<pre><code>Blowfish_encipher((DWORD *) pInput, (DWORD *)(pInput + 4));
</code></pre>

<p>//meaning the code is passing the first two if statements and then leaves the loop and the function.</p>

<p>From my point of view,the solution is hidden somewhere inside the encipher function:</p>

<pre><code>void cBlowFish::Blowfish_encipher(DWORD *xl, DWORD *xr)
{
union aword Xl, Xr;

Xl.dword = *xl;
Xr.dword = *xr;

Xl.dword ^= PArray [0];
ROUND(Xr, Xl, 1);  
ROUND(Xl, Xr, 2);
ROUND(Xr, Xl, 3);  
ROUND(Xl, Xr, 4);
ROUND(Xr, Xl, 5);  
ROUND(Xl, Xr, 6);
ROUND(Xr, Xl, 7);  
ROUND(Xl, Xr, 8);
ROUND(Xr, Xl, 9);  
ROUND(Xl, Xr, 10);
ROUND(Xr, Xl, 11); 
ROUND(Xl, Xr, 12);
ROUND(Xr, Xl, 13); 
ROUND(Xl, Xr, 14);
ROUND(Xr, Xl, 15); 
ROUND(Xl, Xr, 16);
Xr.dword ^= PArray [17];

*xr = Xl.dword;
*xl = Xr.dword;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The definitions:</p>

<pre><code>#define S(x,i)          (SBoxes[i][x.w.byte##i])
#define bf_F(x)         (((S(x,0) + S(x,1)) ^ S(x,2)) + S(x,3))
#define ROUND(a,b,n)    (a.dword ^= bf_F(b) ^ PArray[n])
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the Blowfish_Encipher function in C++ has two parameters:Input(xl) as dword and Output(xr) as dword.</p>

<p>The C# Blowfish Encrypt_Block function has four parameters,why?</p>

<pre><code>        public void EncryptBlock(uint hi,uint lo,out uint outHi,out uint outLo)
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike the C++ blowfish,EncryptBlock calls Encrypt instead Encrypt to call EncryptBlock.Maybe EncryptBlock is NOT the C++ Blowfish_Encipher?</p>

<p>Anyway,my problem is that when I call the C++ code with that array of 6 bytes requesting the blowfish to encode only the last 4 bytes,it does it.</p>

<p>While If I call the encrypt function in C# with those 4 bytes,it returns 0x00.(If you'd like to see the C# Blowfish,check my first lines - I have added a hyperlink there).</p>

<p>Note I can't change the packet structure,it should be just like that,but encrypted.</p>

<p>I also tried this:</p>

<p>Knowing the C++ Encrpypt functions executes only one call - blowfish Encipher.I tried to call EncryptBlock in C# directly,but there are Hi Uint32 and Low Uint32 as input and output,how to spread them into HI or LO? Will this work if the Encrypt_Block calls blowfish Encrypt in C#? I'm quite not sure.</p>

<p>Good day,</p>

<p>I'm using ASP.NET AJAX PageMethods to dynamically change the text of a Label when a dropdownlist is changed on my page.</p>

<p>I know that the text of Labels are not retained between postbacks when they are changed on client-side, which is my case. I've heard that a solution is to keep the label content in a hidden field, then to set Label text from that field in Page_Load.</p>

<p>However, this solution does not seem really clean to me. Are there any other alternatives or best practices?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<hr>

<p>Just to clarify, I have a dropdownlist with people names. When the dropdownlist get changed, I want, in a label, to put the telephone of that person. However, I thought that doing a full postback was not really the best alternative, so I decided to get the telephone with a PageMethod, passing the Id of the item selected in the dropdownlist to retrieve the telephone, and the put it in the label.</p>

<p>However, since other controls cause a full postback, I lose the telephone on every postback. I know that putting it in a hidden field, then setting it back to the label in Page_Load when there is a full postback would work, but I was wordering if there was another solution. Since WebMethods are marked as static, I cannot write Label.text = person.Telephone; in them.</p>

"705716","1","706505","","2009-04-01 14:14:24","","3","2356","<p>I have two LINQ to SQL classes, CandyBar and DeliciousCandyBar that map to tables of the same name in SQL Server.</p>

<p>There is a 0..1 relationship between CandyBar and DeliciousCandyBar. i.e, A CandyBar can have 0 or 1 DeliciousCandyBars. Conversely a DeliciousCandyBar has exactly one CandyBar.</p>

<p>In LINQ to SQL class, they look (basically) like</p>

<pre><code>class CandyBar {
  public int Id { get;set;} // this is primary key w/ autoincrement identity
  public string Name {get;set;}
  public EntityRef&lt;DeliciousCandyBar&gt; DeliciousCandyBar {get;set;}
}

class DeliciousCandyBar {
  public int DeliciousnessFactor {get;set;}
  public int CandyBarId {get;set;} // FK to candyBar Id
  public EntityRef&lt;CandyBar&gt; CandyBar {get;set;} // the association property of the FK
}
</code></pre>

<p>To feed the database (via l2sql), my crawler goes out and finds candy bars and delicious candy bar.</p>

<p>But, with the first delicious candy bar my crawler inserts into the CandyStoreDataContext, the DataContext throws an exception when SubmitChanges is called.</p>

<p>The crawler runs the following code for one delicious candy bar. Please note this is an example. The exact process is more complex and I use a custom DSL crawler that spits out this object structure. Essentially, the following is performed.</p>

<pre><code>var dc = CandyStoreDataContext();
var bar = new CandyBar() {
    Name = ""Flake"",
    DeliciousCandyBar = new DeliciousCandyBar() {
      DeliciousnessFactory = 12
    }
};

dc.CandyBars.InsertOnSubmit(bar);

dc.SubmitChanges();
</code></pre>

<p>On SubmitChanges(), a SqlException is thrown with the message ""The INSERT statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint FK_CandyBar_DeliciousCandyBar. The conflict occured in database CandyStoreData, table 'dbo.DeliciousCandyBar', column 'CandyBarId'"".</p>

<p>The problem became clear when I dumped the CandyStoreDataContext.Log to Console.Out, the generated insert statements were round the wrong way. LINQ to SQL was trying to insert the DeliciousCandyBar first (which tried to set an invalid  value in CandyBarId column), rather than inserting CandyBar first.</p>

<p>My question is, how do I get Linq to SQL to swap with the order of the insert statements? </p>

<p>I had assumed (incorrectly) that LINQ to SQL would know the direction of relationship dependency and do it the other way around.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/linqtosql/thread/fc08009e-37c3-48d5-9a87-b7bb60edf77a/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This post</a> suggests I have the Association the wrong way around. But that doesn't make sense to me. It makes sense when modelled in the database. How could this be done the other way around.</p>

<p>On CandyBar, the association attribute on DelciousCandyBar property is 
[Association(Name=""DeliciousCandyBar_CandyBar"", Storage=""_DeliciousCandyBar"", ThisKey=""Id"", OtherKey=""CandyBarId"", IsForeignKey=true)]</p>

<p>On DeliciousCandyBar, the association attribute on CandyBar property is 
[Association(Name=""DeliciousCandyBar_CandyBar"", Storage=""_CandyBar"", ThisKey=""CandyBarId"", OtherKey=""Id"", IsUnique=true, IsForeignKey=false)]</p>

<p>Okay, now I'm confused, why is the second attribute marked as the foreign key.</p>

<p>I'm going to try recreating that relationship between CandyBar and DeliciousCandyBar in SQL Management studio</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>Okay, I tried creating the relationship both ways. And SSMS makes it really clear where the primary key is located (CandyBar.Id). I had it right the first time. Otherwise, the cascading would go backwards.</p>

<p>I build a ARM library (static library - .a file) of C code using RVDS 3.2 compiler toolchain on Windows host.  Then I link this library with an application using an ARM-Linux compiler toolchain on a Linux host, to get a ARM executable. Now when I try to debug this generated ARM executable on Linux using gdb, by trying to put a breakpoint in some function which is present in the library that is linked, gdb is not able to put breakpoint there citing source not found. So I manually copied all the source files(*.c) used to create the library in the Linux folder where the executable file is present. Still gdb fails to put a breakpoint.
So now I started thinking:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How can I do source level debugging of this library which I create on Windows using a different compiler chain by launching the executable which is generated by linking this library to an application, in gdb. Is it possible? How can I do it? Is there any compiler option in RVDS compiler toolchain to enable this library source level debug?</p></li>

<p>I'm using <a href=""http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNETMVCSessionAtMix08TDDAndMvcMockHelpers.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Scott Hanselmanns MVC Mock Helper</a> to assist in mocking the HttpContext.
I've succesfully (after some time) mocked some of what I need but have come unstuck when it comes to the Application property of the HttpContext.</p>

<p>In my application I store an object in the Application and retrieve it within a Controller like:</p>

<pre><code>SomeObj foo = (SomeObj)Application[""fooKey""];
</code></pre>

<p>This gets created on Application_Start in my MVC App.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED FOLLOWING FIRST ANSWER</strong> (additional code for clarity)
Currently in the test setup I do:</p>

<pre><code>HttpContextBase mockHttpBase = mocks.FakeHttpContext();
controllerToTest = new SomeController();
mocks.SetFakeControllerContext(controllerToTest);


HttpApplicationStateBase appState = 
    MockRepository.GenerateStub&lt;HttpApplicationStateBase&gt;();

Globals tmpAppGlobals = 
    new Globals();

mockHttpBase.Expect(ctx =&gt; ctx.Application).Return(appState);
mockHttpBase.Expect(ctx =&gt; ctx.Application[Globals.GlobalsKey]).
    Return(tmpAppGlobals);
</code></pre>

<p>In my unit test setup I do:</p>

<pre><code>Globals tmpAppGlobals = new Globals();
controllerToTest.ControllerContext.HttpContext.
            Expect(ctx =&gt; ctx.Application[Globals.GlobalsKey]).
Return(tmpAppGlobals);
</code></pre>

<p>This call throws a NullReference Exception, for the Application object.</p>

<p>My question is two fold:</p>

<p>1) Is this the right approach or have I done something wrong from a design / architecture perspective?</p>

<p>2) Why doesn't this work?!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to enable this, WPF provides

</blockquote>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>It looks like the Logical Tree used for binding by <code>ElementName</code>.</p>

<p>Argument # 1.</p>

<p>According to MSDN article <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.frameworkelement.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FrameworkElement Class</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FrameworkElement extends UIElement
  and adds the following capabilities:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Support for data binding and
  dynamic resource references: The
  property-level support for data
  binding and resources is implemented
  by the DependencyProperty class and
  embodied in the property system, but
  the ability to resolve a member value
  that is stored as an Expression (the
  programming construct that underlies
  both data binding and dynamic
  resources) is implemented by
  FrameworkElement. For more
  information, see Data Binding Overview
  and Resources Overview.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Argument # 2.</p>

<p><code>ElementName</code> points to <code>x:Name</code>, so this name should be found some how. There is a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.namescope.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NameScope</a> concept.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For most scenarios, the FindName
  methods exposed on FrameworkElement
  and FrameworkContentElement are more
  appropriate methods to call to search
  for elements by name. The Name
  properties exposed by FrameworkElement
  and FrameworkContentElement are more
  appropriate properties to use to set
  the initial name as markup attributes.
  And the RegisterName methods exposed
  on FrameworkElement and
  FrameworkContentElement is necessary
  to establish a name into a specific
  namescope (there is no NameScope
  member that can do this directly; you
  must set the current namescope first
  to use RegisterName).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.visual.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Visual class</a> neither have <code>FindName</code> method, nor implement <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.markup.inamescope.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">INameScope</a>.</p>

since you guys have been a great help, I was kinda hoping that you could help me once again while having the following question:
I am currently trying to work with AJAX by allowing a managerclass in PHP to communicate via an XmlHttpobject with the javascript on the clientside. However, I can send something to the client via JSON, but I cannot read it at the clientside. In fact I am getting the error that the ""time"" is an undefined index in Session. So I was wondering: what am I doing wrong? </p>

<p>The javascriptcode for Ajax:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
            var sendReq = GetXmlHttpObject();
            var receiveReq = GetXmlHttpObject();
            var JSONIn = 0;
            var JSONOut= 0;
            //var mTimer;   
//function to retreive xmlHTTp object for AJAX calls (correct)
function GetXmlHttpObject()
{
    var xmlHttp=null;
    try
     {
         // Firefox, Opera 8.0+, Safari
         xmlHttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
     }
    catch (e)
     {
         // Internet Explorer
        try
        {
        xmlHttp=new ActiveXObject(""Msxml2.XMLHTTP"");
        }
        catch (e)
        {
            xmlHttp=new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP"");
        }
     }
    return xmlHttp;
}

            //Gets the new info from the server
            function getUpdate() {
                if (receiveReq.readyState == 4 || receiveReq.readyState == 0) {
                    receiveReq.open(""GET"", ""index.php?json=""+JSONIn+""&amp;sid=$this-&gt;session"", true);
                    receiveReq.onreadystatechange = updateState; 
                    receiveReq.send(null);
                }           
            }
            //send a message to the  server.
            function sendUpdate(JSONstringsend) {

                    sendReq.onreadystatechange = updateCycle;
                    sendReq.send(JSONstringsend);
                }                           
            }
            //When data has been send, update the page.
            function updateCycle() {
                getUpdate();
            }
            function updateState() {
                if (receiveReq.readyState == 4) {
                    // JSONANSWER gets here (correct):

                    var JSONobject = JSON.parse(JSONtext);

                }
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The function that actually uses the ajax code:
        </p>

<pre><code>//datepickerdata
        $(document).ready(function(){
                $(""#datepicker"").datepicker({
                    onSelect: function(dateText){
                    var JSONObject = {""date"": dateText};
                    var JSONstring = JSON.stringify(JSONObject);
                    sendUpdate(JSONstring);
                    },  
                    dateFormat: 'dd-mm-yy' 
            });

        });

        &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the PHP code:</p>

<pre><code>private function handleReceivedJSon($json){
    $this-&gt;jsonLocal=array();
    $json=$_POST[""json""];
    $this-&gt;jsonDecoded= json_decode($json, true);
    if(isset($this-&gt;jsonDecoded[""date""])){
        $_SESSION[""date""]=$this-&gt;jsonDecoded[""date""];
        $this-&gt;useddate=$this-&gt;jsonDecoded;

    }
    if(isset($this-&gt;jsonDecoded[""logout""])){
        session_destroy();
        exit(""logout"");
    }
    header(""Last-Modified: "" . gmdate( ""D, d M Y H:i:s"" ) . ""GMT"" );

I understand that this is a new security ""feature"" in IE and that it is being blocked because it believes that the download wasn't triggered by the user interaction with the web page. The users can choose to allow the download and that setting seems to be remembered for the rest of the session. However next time they open the page it happens again.

<p>Im using Flash to call an AMFPHP service that queries my database and returns the result resource. Before returning the result to the Flash movie I need to edit some of the values in the result resource. </p>

<p>How can i iterate through the rows of the result, change some values and 'repackage' the resource to return to Flash? </p>

<p>I have thought of - </p>

<pre><code>$sql = sprintf(""SELECT file_name FROM ...."");
$result = mysql_query($sql);
while($row=mysql_fetch_array($result)){ 
    $row['file_name'] = performFunctionOn($row['file_name']);
}
$row = 0;
if(!mysql_data_seek($result,$row))continue;
return $result

<p>The two columns in the range are named 'Item' &amp; 'Price'.</p>

<p>'Item' is a column of items concatenated from formulas on a spreadsheet, and these appear fine in the DataTable. However, none of the values in the 'Price' column (all number values from VLOOKUP formulas) appear in the DataTable.</p>

<p>When loading the DataTable in C#, I can see that the two columns' types of string and double are fine. If I replace one of the formula derived values with a hard-coded value the DataTable is fine, so I guess the DataTable itself is working as expected.</p>

<p>If I open the Excel file after the values are passed into it, I can see that the input values went in fine and the formulas have calculated correctly.</p>

<p>So, the only thing I can think is causing the problem is that the formulas are not being recalculated after the values are passed into it.</p>

<p>Is there a way to open an excel file in C# and get it to recalculate all the formulas?</p>

<p>The task now is to start f(x-1) and f(x-2) each in a separate Thread.
One time with implementing the Thread class and the other with implementing Runnable.
As you probably know, it's an exercise from my prof.</p>

<p>I know how to start a Thread in Java and I know how this whole Thread thing theoretically works, but I can't find a solution for starting separate Threads in this recursive function.</p>

<p>What has to be done in the run function?</p>

<p>Probably</p>

<pre><code>public void run(){
//int foo=start f(this.x-1)
    //int bar=start f(this.x-2)  
    //return foo+bar?
}

<p>And how can I paste x in my runnable function?
Is x passed into the object at creation?</p>

  public ... f(x)....

<p>EDIT 2: After giving the bounty I found that I was wrong about 1.2.9-SNAPSHOT version of Axiom. I built it again, made sure the jars where correctly copied to lib directory and it worked!</p>

<p>Finally, it was an Axiom bug, as said in the links provided by Vineet.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"706167","1","1437189","","2009-04-01 15:52:10","","15","6557","<p>A problem I was working on recently got me to wishing that I could lop off the front of a file. Kind of like a “truncate at front,” if you will. Truncating a file at the back end is a common operation–something we do without even thinking much about it. But lopping off the front of a file? Sounds ridiculous at first, but only because we’ve been trained to think that it’s impossible. But a lop operation could be useful in some situations.</p>

<p>A simple example (certainly not the only or necessarily the best example) is a FIFO queue. You’re adding new items to the end of the file and pulling items out of the file from the front. The file grows over time and there’s a huge empty space at the front. With current file systems, there are several ways around this problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>As each item is removed, copy the
remaining items up to replace it, and
truncate the file. Although it works,
this solution is very expensive
time-wise.</li>
<li>Monitor the size of the empty space at
the front, and when it reaches a
particular size or percentage of the
entire file size, move everything up
and truncate the file. This is much
more efficient than the previous
solution, but still costs time when
items are moved in the file.</li>
<li>Implement a circular queue in the
file, adding new items to the hole at
the front of the file as items are
removed. This can be quite efficient,
especially if you don’t mind the
possibility of things getting out of
order in the queue. If you do care
about order, there’s the potential of
having to move items around. But in
general, a circular queue is pretty
easy to implement and manages disk
space well.</li>
</ul>

<p>But if there was a lop operation, removing an item from the queue would be as easy as updating the beginning-of-file marker. As easy, in fact, as truncating a file. Why, then, is there no such operation?</p>

<p>I understand a bit about file systems implementation, and don't see any particular reason this would be difficult.  It looks to me like all it would require is another word (dword, perhaps?) per allocation entry to say where the file starts within the block.  With 1 terabyte drives under $100 US, it seems like a pretty small price to pay for such functionality.</p>

<p>What other tasks would be made easier if you could lop off the front of a file as efficiently as you can truncate at the end?</p>

<p>Can you think of any technical reason this function couldn't be added to a modern file system?  Other, non-technical reasons?</p>

Traditionally we have been using the GAC and Policy Files to control DLL versions for our .NET applications.  However, we have a very unique situation and are running into major problems with this, as some of our applications do NOT respect the policy files.  Most specifically the .NET 2.0 applications that reference .NET 1.1 dll's that have a Policy File.</p>

<p>We have a blended mix of items that run dynamically (loaded via reflection) in a windows application as well as a large number of web applications.  We are looking to move to more of a ""Centralized DLL Store"" rather than worrying about GAC versioning.  But we can't seem to find a way to tell our application to ""Look here for any DLL's"".</p>

<p>Looking at some of the assembly information nodes (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/twy1dw1e.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/twy1dw1e.aspx</a>) we can get part way there, but we must define each and Every DLL that should be looked up, this is not possible as we have about 200 different applications that would require regular web.config updates as we update versions of the shared DLLs.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a good idea on how we can move the DLL references?  CopyLocal isn't an option as we have times where we NEED applications to use the new versions of the shared DLLs.  The GAC, at least right now, isn't really an option either.</p>

<p><strong>Table: Employee</strong></p>

<p>That records that employee 0 (Alice) will move to department 2 on 05/05/2009.</p>

<p>I want to write a query to determine the employee's department on a particular date. So it needs to:</p>

<li>If none exists then default to the value currently in the master employee table.</li>

<p>How can I do this?

<p>I have an idea for a website that educators could use. (High School Teachers, Curriculum Reviewers, College Professors, etc...)</p>

<p>I want to build a community site simular to StackOverflow. However, the UX will not be the same, because the users are not as web savy as we are. Anyway, I don't want to think too much about UI at this stage. Right now, it is just an idea.</p>

<p>What are some best practices for building a community site?</p>

<p>I have also looked at Digg.com for ideas.</p>

<p>So far I like the concepts:
1) Votes on everything
2) User Reputation
3) Badges</p>

<p>What other things are useful?</p>

<p>As kind of a sub question, is there a way to determine if someone is an educator?
If I charged a registration fee (small, very very small) I could maybe have a human call and verify they are who they claim.
However, that seems wrong to me to charge the users.</p>

<p>There are many companies that would LOVE to SPAM these individuals. 
How do I keep the SPAMers out, and verify that those registering really are educators?
Should I even try? Or, just let the community police itself.</p>

<p>I have many question and I am just looking for some guidance.

<p>Is my problem that I am declaring a NEW frmWWCModuleHost instead of passing a ref to the existing?  I am still pretty weak in my understanding of this.</p>

<hr>

<h2>EDIT 3</h2>

<hr>

<p>I have ""solved"" this by doing the following:  On the Parent Form where I declare the Child Form I pass <em>this</em> as a param.  Then in the constructor of the child form I added _frmWWCModuleHost = m_parent;  I have a UpdateHUD() method on my Parent form and I call it from the _CellClick event on the child.</p>

<p>Now to rephrase my question; Is there anything glaringly wrong with doing it this way?</p>

<p>I spent a day writing this code and can anyone tell me what is wrong here?</p>

<p>WSHelper is inherited from NSObject, I even tried NSDocument and NSObjectController and everything..</p>

<pre><code>-(void) loadUrl: (NSString*) urlStr{
    url = [[NSURL alloc] initWithString:urlStr];
    request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url cachePolicy: NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringCacheData timeoutInterval: 60.0];
    connection = [[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:request delegate:self startImmediately:YES];
    if(connection)
    {
        receivedData = [[NSMutableData data] retain];
            //[connection start];
    }
    else
    {       display error etc...   }
    NSApplication * app = [NSApplication sharedApplication];
    [app runModalForWindow: waitWindow];// &lt;-- this is the problem...
}

-(void)connection: (NSURLConnection*)connection didReceiveData:(NSData*)data{
    progressText = @""Receiving Data..."";
    [receivedData appendData:data];
}

-(void)connection: (NSURLConnection *)connection didFailWithError:(NSError *)error{
    progressText = @""Error..."";
    NSAlert * alert = [[NSAlert alloc] init];
    [alert setMessageText:[error localizedDescription]];
    [alert runModal];
}


- (void)connectionDidFinishLoading:(NSURLConnection *)connection{
    progressText = @""Done..."";
    pData = [[NSData alloc] initWithData:receivedData];
    [self hideWindow];
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code just wont do anything, it doesnt progress at all. I even tried it with/without startImmediately:YES but no luck !!!, this is executed in main window so even the thread and its run loop is running successfully.</p>

<p>I tried calling synchronous request, and it is working correctly !! But I need async solution.</p>

<p>I have added CoreServices.Framework in project, is there anything more I should be adding to the project? any compiler settings? Or do i have to initialize anything before I can use NSURLConnection?</p>

<p>Any solution to run NSURLConnection on different thread on its own NSRunLoop, Objective-C and MAC Development has no sample code anywhere in documentation that makes everything so difficult to code.</p>

<p>It works fine without compression but if I compress JSON responses, I can not see my JSON objects anymore. I handle JSON Ajax calls with JQuery with code snippets as follows:    </p>

<pre><code>    $.post(url,parameters, function(json) {
    // Do some DOM manipulation with the data contained in the JSON Object
}, ""json"");
</code></pre>

<p>If I see the response with Firebug it is empty. </p>

<p>Should I refractor my compression filter to skip compression in JSON responses? or there is a workaround to this?</p>

<p>For me, it looks like JQuery does not recognize the response as JSON because I am adding the Gzip compression. </p>

I want to continuously update controls on my page based on user entered values, e.g. update totals. The calculations are embedded in business logic but they're simple enough to reproduce elsewhere. I've thought of three ways to accomplish this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dynamically update the page using JavaScript. I don't want to do this because I don't want to risk floating point math problems where the values on the page don't match the values calculated by the business class (those properties are decimals).</li>
<li>Clear calculated fields on changes and force the user to click a re-calculate button. This is a poor user experience and wiring up JavaScript to ASP.NET controls is tedious.</li>
<li>Use an AJAX UpdatePanel, set data entry controls to autopostback, and handle the ""changed"" event for the control, e.g. TextChanged for TextBox.</li>
</ol>

<p>The third method seems cleanest to me, provides a nice user experience, and allows me to interact directly with my business class that I've stored in session state.</p>

<p>My question is: Is this a good idea and/or a common practice? Are there better ways to accomplish this?</p>

<p>I haven't done ASP.NET work for a few years and I have a prejudice against autopostback[1]. I've looked at the size of the request and it's currently negligible at 1.5kB. The site will be low use but we may have a small number of users with dial-up connections.</p>

<li>And ASP.NET in general but times are tough.</li>

    The user opens a document in Word 2003, and within the Normal.dot <code>AutoOpen</code> macro, we look at current document, and if it has been opened by clicking on a link on a webpage, and meets certain other application specific criteria, close the streamed 'copy' and open the source document (found on a shared drive we can assume the user has access to):</p>

<pre><code>Documents.Open origDoc
Documents(ActiveDocument.FullName).Close SaveChanges:=wdDoNotSaveChanges
Documents(origDoc).Activate

    ''# Do work
End With

<p>My thought was that I needed to call <code>Activate</code> to ensure that the original document was the <code>ActiveDocument</code>, but I'm getting a 4160 'Bad file name' error on the <code>.Activate</code> call.  If I comment out the call to <code>.Activate</code>, it appears that <code>ActiveDocument</code> is set to the origDoc  document, even if there were other documents already opened (I'm not really sure how the Documents Collection is managed, and how Word determines what next <code>ActiveDocument</code> would be if you programatically close the current ActiveDocument)</p>

<p>So, does calling <code>.Open</code> on a document explicitly set the Document to be the <code>ActiveDocument</code>?  Also, does calling <code>.Activate</code> on the already active document cause an error? </p>

<p>I haven't really been able to find much documentation about this, so thanks in advance for any suggestions and insight!</p>

Is there a way I can follow to ensure that isValid() is called other than calling super?
I dislike very much the fact that I have to pass parameters all around, I think I'm going totally in the wrong direction and there is a cleaner way to achieve this.
What I would like to keep in my code is the ""isValid() calling logic"" in the abstract class, because every call needs to be validated and I can't rely on me remembering this in the future :P</p>

I have an object lets call it a Manager, the Manager has a collection of people that he manages, the people all implement IPerson, but different types of people have different properties. I want to display this manager in a tree, and under the manager node I want to show all the projects he is managing which can be determined from the people he manages. </p>

<p>So the plan is to use a converter to convert a person into a List of projects. Here is the XAML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;HierarchicalDataTemplate DataType=""{x:Type ui:Manager}""&gt;
   &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding Path=Name}""/&gt;
    &lt;HierarchicalDataTemplate.ItemTemplate&gt;
        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
                    &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding}""/&gt;
        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/HierarchicalDataTemplate.ItemTemplate&gt;
    &lt;HierarchicalDataTemplate.ItemsSource&gt;
        &lt;Binding Path=""People""&gt;
            &lt;Binding.Converter&gt;
                &lt;configUtil:ProjectListConverter/&gt;
            &lt;/Binding.Converter&gt;
        &lt;/Binding&gt;
    &lt;/HierarchicalDataTemplate.ItemsSource&gt;
&lt;/HierarchicalDataTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My Person class implements INotifyPropertyChanged, and the list holding the people implements INotifyCollectionChanged.This code works great when I set the treeview ItemsSource, the Managers are displayed with their list of projects.</p>

<p>However, when I add a new person to the list of people, the TreeView is not updated. When I debug, I can see that the CollectionChanged is firing with the Add action and the added item. Also the CollectionChanged event is not null so I know the UI is watching it. But the Converter does not execute when the item is added. </p>

<p>here is the Add method for the List holding the IPerson objects:</p>

<pre><code>public void Add(T item)
{
    list.Add(item);
    OnCollectionChanged(new NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs(NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Add, item));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Am I somehow breaking the databinding?</p>

<p>What other things can I check for?</p>

<p>The Converter just looks at each item in the People list and figures out what projects they are working on and adds the project name to an output List.</p>

1.) A call to a web service method <br />
2.) A call to a database</p>

<p>For example, assume that you have a simple web service that just returns an integer that is calculated in X time. You also have a database that, when queried in th right way, also takes X time to calculate the answer. (So the <strong>compute time is the same in both cases</strong>) In both cases, assume the amount of data both directions is the same, say, a single 32-bit integer, for simplicity.</p>

<p>Thus far, the calculation times of both the web service and the database are exactly the same.</p>

<p>The environment is 1 application server, where the app resides, and 1 other server that is holding both the web service and the database. There is nothing else going on in the environment other than the application calling either the web service or database repeatedly. <strong>This all within one single LAN</strong>, so any network latency is equal.</p>

<p>From an application, which will be faster, the call to the database, or the call to the web service?</p>

<p>What I am trying to isolate, I guess, is which is more heavy-weight. Does the set up, open, close, tear down of a database connection end up slower than that for a web service,   or is it the same? Additionally, if there are other things, such as parsing the result from a web service, how do they affect the speed?</p>

<p>I am writing a small function that will return a string, quoted (as quoted-printable) if necessary, otherwise it returns it as is.  A character is input into the function; the result is a string.</p>

<p>What I tried to do at first was:</p>

<pre><code>private string QuotedChar(char ch) {
    if(ch &lt; (char)128 &amp;&amp; !char.IsWhiteSpace(ch))
        return(new string(ch));

<p>However, the compiler says CS0214, ""Pointers and fixed size buffers may only be used in an unsafe context"", when compiling that return statement.  If I change the code to say instead:</p>

<pre><code>private string QuotedChar(char ch) {
    if(ch &lt; (char)128 &amp;&amp; !char.IsWhiteSpace(ch))
        return(new string(new char[] { ch }));

    // ...

<p>... it works just fine.  However that seems rather pointless.  I don't understand why it thinks I am trying to use a pointer or a fixed size buffer, since it's just a char.  Am I missing something seriously silly, or is this a problem/bug?</p>

<p>FYI, this is Mono 2.0, not the Microsoft .NET Framework.  I don't run Windows, so I don't have Microsoft's C# compiler to see if it does the same thing or not, which is why I wonder if it is a bug.</p>

Problem is, the user can specify to have a second installation on a second drive (like e:\MyApp), and they can have two different versions of the application installed at once in either directory.  They can also decide to install the app elsewhere in the directory tree, but those are the two most common locations.</p>

<p>I did not write this scheme.  It makes baby Jesus cry, as far as I'm concerned.</p>

<p>I have to write an installer to add a module to this scheme, and the user needs to be able to select which installation they want to install the module on.  I thought I'd try this in WiX.</p>

<p>How do I do this? </p>

<p>I was going to do a directory search like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Property Id=""MyAppInstallationSearch""&gt;
  &lt;DirectorySearch Id=""MyAppDirectory"" Path=""C:\MyApp""&gt;
  &lt;/DirectorySearch&gt;
&lt;/Property&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and then:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Directory Id=""TARGETDIR"" Name=""MyAppInstallationSearch""&gt;
    &lt;Directory Id=""INSTALLLOCATION"" Name=""AdditionalTools""&gt;
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>to have an installation location.</p>

<p>So how do I:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make that search be relative, not absolute?  (the documentation specifies that this can be done, I just don't see how).</p></li>
<li><p>If the user has multiple locations, give them a choice of which installation to use?</p></li>

<p>The application is quite simple, validates against a text file of a word list, then finds all anagrams.

<p>I've tried several different methods (many of them mentioned in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/320677/how-do-i-set-the-icon-for-my-application-in-visual-studio-2008"">this other question</a>), but I am still having some strange issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When including an icon as a resource, it does show up as the executable file's icon immediately, but for the icon to show up on the taskbar, I have to restart the computer.  Until then, it continues to show up as whatever the previous icon was.  Cleaning the solution, restarting VS, doesn't have any effect.  Not a really big issue, as it won't affect a released exe, but it would be nice to know where it's keeping the old icon cached and how to get rid of it.</p></li>
<li><p>No matter what I do, the icon displayed when alt-tabbing is the default app icon (square and white and generic).  This includes embedding the icon in the executable, as well as setting <code>ICON_BIG</code> with <code>WM_SETICON</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As for the second matter, my code looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>   hIcon = (HICON)(
      LoadImage( NULL, szFilename, IMAGE_ICON, 32, 32, LR_LOADFROMFILE ) );
   if( hIcon )
      SendMessage( hWnd, WM_SETICON, ICON_BIG, (LPARAM)hIcon );
</code></pre>

<p>However, after sending <code>WM_SETICON</code>, <code>GetLastError()</code> returns 6, ""The handle is invalid."".  <code>hWnd</code> is a valid window handle, and <code>hIcon</code> appears to be a valid icon handle.  I've tried searching for reasons why <code>WM_SETICON</code> could cause that error, and at the very least, to figure out WHICH handle it thinks is invalid, but no luck yet.  I've cleared the error code immediately before calling <code>SendMessage()</code>, so it has to be set somewhere in the processing of the message.</p>

<p>I tried an alternate method, loading the icon from the exe itself, where the ID of the resource is <code>101</code> (it's the first and only resource included):</p>

<pre><code>   hIcon = (HICON)(
      LoadImage( GetModuleHandle( NULL ), MAKEINTRESOURCE( 101 ),
      IMAGE_ICON, 48, 48, 0 ) );
   if( hIcon )
      SendMessage( hWnd, WM_SETICON, ICON_BIG, (LPARAM)hIcon );
</code></pre>

<p>... but the same thing happens; after calling <code>SendMessage()</code>, <code>GetLastError()</code> gives the same error status.</p>

<p>I've tried different dimensions (such as 48x48, all of which are present in the icon file), but to no different effect.  I know it's definitely finding and loading the images, because if I specify a size that doesn't exist or an invalid resource ID or the wrong filename (depending on how I am loading it), it fails out long before <code>SendMessage()</code>.</p>

<p>Strangely, if I specify <code>ICON_SMALL</code> instead of <code>ICON_BIG</code>, the call succeeds with no error status, but from <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms632643.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the docs</a>, I need to use <code>ICON_BIG</code> to set the icon used while alt-tabbing.  Also, if I use <code>ICON_BIG</code> but load the 16x16 icon, I get no error status, but nothing changes.</p>

<p>Q1 - If character ‘C’ is saved into viewstate, then just before the page is rendered,Asp.Net serializes ‘C’(along with other data) into Base64 string. If on postback I issue the following code:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<pre><code>protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
     TextBox1.Text = ""ABCDEF"";
     if (IsPostBack)
     {
          string viewStateString=Request[""__VIEWSTATE""];

          byte[] stringBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(viewStateString);

          for (int i = 0; i &lt; stringBytes.Length; i++)
          {
              if(stringBytes[i] == 67)
                    Label1.Text = ”deserialization successful”; 
          }               
     }
 }
</code></pre>

<p><br /></p>

<p>, then FromBase64String() should convert serialized data back into their original format. Thus, one of ‘stringBytes’ fields  should contain a  decimal value 67( which represents ASCII character C) .But that doesn’t seem to be the case. Any ideas what I’m doing wrong?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Q2 - Since String represents a set of Unicode characters, I assume that in the above example when “ABCDEF” is deserialized from the viewstate, each character in “ABCDEF” string is represented with two elements of a ‘stringBytes’ array? </p>

<p>The problem really just concerns the properties table I think, rather than the join, given the following (simplified) table of product properties:</p>

<pre>
id  product_id  property  value
---------------------------------
1   1           color     red
2   1           size      small
3   2           color     red
4   2           size      large

<p>how would I get all the product_ids where value is both 'red' and 'small' ?</p>

<p>A similar question <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/329822/mysql-strict-select-of-rows-involving-many-to-many-tables"">was asked</a> before but not answered very fully. A solution involves a COUNT and HAVING to get the rows where there are as many rows in each group as required values e.g.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT product_id, count(*) AS group_count FROM properties where
value = 'red' OR value = 'small'
GROUP BY product_id
HAVING group_count = 2
</code></pre>

<p>This works but I'm concerned about performance, it seems like there would be a better way.</p>

<p>Eventually this would need to be joined with, or at least used to filter the products table:</p>

<pre>
id  name     
-------------
1   Product 1
2   Product 2
</pre>

<p>I forgot to mention that I have 2 of these properties tables joined to products that I need to filter on, one with regular attributes of a product, another with available configurable options (a bit like variants).
The scenario is to allow users to filter products like:
""show products where gender = 'male', brand = 'nike' and size == 'small'"" where gender and brand are 'properties' and size is in options (configurable when adding to cart)</p>

<p>The solution of using a group with a count works with the 2 joined tables still but it gets messy, the required  group count is the number of required options on the first table multiplied by the number on the second.</p>

<p>I could just fetch the ids from properties (and the other table) then just do a select where id IN(ids), matching a set of ids for both property tables, I don't  like the idea of doing this with a really long list of ids though.</p>

I need to be able to run an arbitrary subroutine on another thread that also looks at these objects (search functionality, if you're curious).  The obvious issue is that a user could be editing one of these objects at the same time my search thread is reading it, which would be preferable to avoid (although it probably won't result in anything critical since my search thread is just reading, not writing).</p>

<p>Calling <code>lock(obj)</code> is easy enough from my search thread, but after looking through the documentation and a brief skim through the PropertyDescriptorGridEntry code in Reflector, I cannot seem to find an analogous spot to use a <code>System.Threading.Monitor.Enter()/Exit()</code> call on the object in question on the PropertyGrid.  I was hoping there would be BeginEdit and EndEdit events which would make this simple enough, but I can't seem to find any such thing.  I'd rather not lock the entire object while it's on display in the PropertyGrid as that would obviously block my search thread until another object was selected.</p>

<p>I'm a bit new to the threading model of Windows Forms, so I'm hoping there's some obvious answer I've just overlooked.  Any help?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Synchronously cloning my objects before running the search asynchronously will likely be inefficient enough that I might as well run the search itself synchronously - the point of running asynchronously is of course to allow my users to continue to work while the search is executing.  The search needs to scale well, as the data set I am going through will eventually end up being arbitrarily large, which makes synchronous cloning look like it will cause the usability problem I am trying to avoid.</p>

<p>Re: ""Can you see the Django app from the machine it's running on?""</p>

<p>Yes. It does work on the same machine. It does not work across the network.</p>

<p>I can also set the server to run on whatever port I choose (80, 8000, etc.) and it is accessible locally, not across the network.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q. Is it netstat-able?
A. Yes:</p>

<pre><code>  Proto  Local Address          Foreign Address        State
  ....
  TCP    D3FL2J71:http          localhost:1140         TIME_WAIT
  TCP    D3FL2J71:http          localhost:1147         TIME_WAIT
</code></pre>

<p>I have the website visible in two browser windows locally.</p>

<hr>

<p>Use explicit external port (not rely on localhost):</p>

<pre><code>python manage.py runserver 192.168.x.x:8000
</code></pre>

<p>Bing bing bing! We have a winner!</p>

<p>Wow, am I ever glad this is not a networking problem.</p>

<hr>

<p>""is the Django app definitely advertising itself on the 192.168.x.x address and not just on the loopback adapter?""</p>

<p>It seems Jon was on the right track, too, but the comment did not point me in the direction to look -- check the Django server's setup call.</p>

<pre><code>Subscribes&lt;EventType&gt;(ISubscriber&lt;EventType&gt; subscriber) 
// and some other methods for adding subscribers
</code></pre>

<p>And for publishing events.</p>

<pre><code>Publish&lt;EventType&gt;(EventType @event)
</code></pre>

<p>Quite simple. I want to route <code>Publish&lt;int&gt;(0)</code> to all subscribers implementing <code>ISubscriber&lt;int&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>What's not too hard is, that I want the subscribers EventType to be contravariant. So <code>ISubscriber&lt;object&gt;</code> should basically consume everything. Not shure wether I want them to consume valuetypes, too.</p>

<p>With C#4 that is no problem, but now I'm doing this stuff with C#3 and just faking contravariance with an interface:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IContravariantGenerics { 
  object AsVariantFor(Type[] genericParamters);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Well, now, I want to empack data into ""event types"" like this. The generic parameters of that events must be covariant.</p>

<pre><code>SubX : ISubscriber&lt;DataChanged&lt;A&gt;&gt;

DataChanged&lt;T&gt;
  T Data {get;}
</code></pre>

<p>When I publish <code>Publish&lt;DataChanged&lt;B&gt;&gt;(new DataChanged&lt;B&gt;(new B())</code> (given B : A), the Subscriber should be notified with <code>DataChanged&lt;A&gt;</code> where Data is the B-instance passed to <code>DataChanged&lt;B&gt;</code>. So I need covariance support as well.</p>

<p>I thought of  writing a lib that supports both Co-/And Contravariance like this:</p>

<pre><code>IMyObject&lt;T1, T2&gt; : IWithVariance&lt;In, Out&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which would allow conversions (not casts!) like this:</p>

<pre><code>Obj&lt;Fruit, Fruit&gt; x;
IMyObject&lt;Apple, object&gt; x2 = x.ToVariant&lt;Apple, object&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>What do you think? Is it possible? Thought of doing it using dynamic proxies.</p>

<p>""The problem reduces to this question: Do two lines from A to B and from C to D intersect? Then you can ask it four times (between the line and each of the four sides of the rectangle).</p>

<p>Here's the vector math for doing it. I'm assuming the line from A to B is the line in question and the line from C to D is one of the rectangle lines. My notation is that Ax is the ""x-coordinate of A"" and Cy is the ""y-coordinate of C."" And ""*"" means dot-product, so e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>A*B = Ax*Bx + Ay*By.
E = B-A = ( Bx-Ax, By-Ay )
F = D-C = ( Dx-Cx, Dy-Cy ) 
P = ( -Ey, Ex )
h = ( (A-C) * P ) / ( F * P )
</code></pre>

<p>This h number is the key. If h is between 0 and 1, the lines intersect, otherwise they don't. If F<em>P is zero, of course you cannot make the calculation, but in this case the lines are parallel and therefore only intersect in the obvious cases.
The exact point of intersection is C + F</em>h.
If h is exactly 0 or 1 the lines touch at an end-point. You can consider this an ""intersection"" or not as you see fit.""</p>

<p>For data that I created (small data with double values) I obtained good results with all the 4 implemented methods. When I use anyone of these methods implemented in C++ on the data from the big graph I get different results each time and not good results:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>method returns much more intersections that I need (all the points are on the graph) but I get too many points.</p></li>
<li><p>I always obtain 0 intersections no matter what.</p></li>
<li><p>I get a lot more intersection than in 1.</p></li>
<li><p>For some example I get points which are not on the graph (so not even the intersection). But for some examples I get the intersection points plus some other points.</p></li>

<pre><code>// B.SYNTAX is a TEXT/CLOB field
// Indexes on NAME, MODULENAME. PREVIOUS is a CHAR(1) with no index
""SELECT A.NAME, B.SYNTAX, B.DESCRIPTION, A.RATE1, A.RATE2,

FROM A, B WHERE A.MODULENAME='""+loadedModuleName+""' 
AND A.NAME = B.NAME AND (A.PREVIOUS&lt;&gt;'N' OR A.PREVIOUS IS NULL) 
ORDER BY A.NAME""
</code></pre>

<p>The size of table A is ~2000 rows and B is about ~500.</p>

<p>I should probably also mention that I cannot do much database specific optimization since we support multiple databases. Also, the application is deployed at a customer site.</p>

<p>I am expecting hundreds of records to be returned (less than 1000).</p>

<p>What would you do? Any tips are appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>It should be pretty easy to create a regular expression to check that the general syntax of the argument placeholders match ""<code>{index[,alignment][:formatString]}</code>"" per <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/txafckwd.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the documentation</a>.  And not too much more difficult to verify that the indexes of the placeholders in the composite format string are less than the actual number of typed arguments (i.e. they don't reference an argument that won't be given).  However, given the types for the arguments that will be passed in are known, it should also be possible to validate the ""<code>:formatString</code>"" is appropriate for those types.</p>

<p>For example, you want to validate the user doesn't specify ""<code>{0:dddd MMMM}</code>"" as a format string when the first argument type (0 index) is a number (<code>String.Format(""{0:dddd MMMM}"", 1234)</code> yields ""<code>dddd MMMM</code>"").  The quantity of ""<code>:formatString</code>"" options by type is <a href=""http://john-sheehan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/msnet-formatting-strings.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">too large</a> to want to manually check everything.  Is there any other way?  Or do you just have to live with the user potentially specifying a bad format string?</p>

<p>But then yesterday Day X + 4 it lost a lot of data.</p>

<p>Database B is on a server with another instance of SQL Server and they both started to run out of memory(conflicting with each other). </p>

<p>Here is the sequence of events from the event log when I think this happened.</p>

AppDomain 2 (DatabaseB.dbo[runtime].1) unloaded.

The simple recovery model should be used to automatically truncate the transaction log. (on DatabaseB)

AppDomain 3 (DatabaseB.dbo[runtime].2) created.

<p>So here is my dilema...how could this have happened?</p>

<p>How can several days data go missing from DatabaseB?? (it subsequently is missing from the publication db also!)</p>

<p>Did the truncate with the Appdomain down cause the data to be flushed from the log?</p>

It looks like a linking problem but using static library instead the dynamic one and it would be also useful to apply a strip in order to remove the unused symbols.</p>

<pre><code>using(StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(File.Open(""somefile.txt"", FileMode.Open)))
{
    //read file
}
File.Move(""somefile.txt"", ""somefile.bak""); //can't move, get exception that I the file is open

<p>I thought that because the <code>using</code> clause explicitly called <code>Close()</code> and <code>Dispose()</code> on the <code>StreamReader</code> that the <code>FileStream</code> would be closed as well. </p>

<p>The only way I could fix the problem I was having was by changing the above block to this:</p>

<pre><code>using(FileStream fs = File.Open(""somefile.txt"", FileMode.Open))
{
  using(StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(fs))

}

File.Move(""somefile.txt"", ""somefile.bak""); // can move file with no errors

<p>Should closing the <code>StreamReader</code> by disposing in the first block also close the underlying <code>FileStream</code>? Or, was I mistaken?</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>I decided to post the actual offending block of code, to see if we can get to the bottom of this. I am just curious now.</p>

<p>I thought I had a problem in the <code>using</code> clause, so I expanded everything out, and it still can't copy, every time. I create the file in this method call, so I don't think anything else has a handle open on the file. I've also verified that the strings returned from the <code>Path.Combine</code> calls are correct.</p>

<pre><code>private static void GenerateFiles(List&lt;Credit&gt; credits)
{
    Account i;
    string creditFile = Path.Combine(Settings.CreditLocalPath, DateTime.Now.ToString(""MMddyy-hhmmss"") + "".credits"");

    creditsFile.WriteLine(""code\inc"");

            c.Error = true;
            c.ErrorMessage = ""NO ACCOUNT"";
        }

        DataAccessLayer.AddCredit(c);

    }

    creditsFile.Close();
    creditsFile.Dispose();

<p>There is a table of tracking data for a quiz program where each row has..</p>

<p>QuestionID and AnswerID (there is a table for each). So because of a bug there were a bunch of QuestionIDs set to NULL, but the QuestionID of a related AnswerID is in the Answers table.</p>

<p>So say QuestionID is NULL and AnswerID is 500, if we go to the Answers table and find AnswerID 500 there is a column with the QuestionID that should have been where the NULL value is.</p>

<p>So basically I want to set each NULL QuestionID to be equal to the QuestionID found in the Answers table on the Answer row of the AnswerID that is in the trackings table (same row as the NULL QuestionID that is being written).</p>

<p>How would I do this?</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE QuestionTrackings
SET QuestionID = (need some select query that will get the QuestionID from the AnswerID in this row)
WHERE QuestionID is NULL AND ... ?

However I was wondering if it's possible to add events to it. I found a plugin (jQuery) that enables the user to hover over a td with class ""event"" and an event will be displayed. So since this calendar will not be used by me but by someone else who knows nothing about developing I was wondering if there is a way to make a php file or upload or something so she can upload the event. I mean, let's say she wants an event on the 3rd then she uploads a file php reads it and tells javascript to add the class ""event"" that date and jQuery does the rest. Is it possible? I can't even figure out how to do it and I really hope I explained myself. Here's my javascript btw.</p>

<pre><code>function buildCal(){
    var d = new Date();
    var month = d.getMonth()+1;
    var year = d.getFullYear();
    var monthName=['Enero','Febrero','Marzo','Abril','Mayo','Junio','Julio','Agosto','Septiembre','Octubre','Noviembre','Diciembre'];
    var daysInMonth=[31,0,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31];

    var objectDay = new Date(year, month-1, 1); //fix date bug when current day is 31st
    objectDay.od=objectDay.getDay()+1; //fix date bug when current day is 31st

    var todaydate=new Date() 
    var scanfortoday=(year==todaydate.getFullYear() &amp;&amp; month==todaydate.getMonth()+1)? todaydate.getDate() : 0 //DD added

    daysInMonth[1]=(((objectDay.getFullYear()%100!=0)&amp;&amp;(objectDay.getFullYear()%4==0))||(objectDay.getFullYear()%400==0))?29:28;

    var t='&lt;div class=""main""&gt;&lt;table class=""main"" cols=""7"" cellpadding=""0"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0""&gt;';
    t+='&lt;h3 class=""monthCSS"" align=""center""&gt;'+monthName[month-1]+' - '+year+'&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;tr align=""center""&gt;';


    for(s=0;s&lt;7;s++)t+='&lt;td class=""daysofweek""&gt;'+""DoLuMaMiJuViSa"".substr(s*2,2)+'&lt;/td&gt;';

    t+='&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr align=""center""&gt;';
    for(i=2;i&lt;=42;i++){
        var x=((i-objectDay.od&gt;=0)&amp;&amp;(i-objectDay.od&lt;daysInMonth[month-1]))? i-objectDay.od+1 : '&amp;nbsp;';

    }
    return t+='&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;';

</code></pre>

<p>Something else, as you can see here, it adds blankspaces until it gets to an actual date. I was trying to make it check if(x was not a number) then add a td class=""padding"" however to do this I was trying to use x.match(/[0-9]+/) but it didn't seem to work and it would also be the first time I try to use regex with javascript would anyone know why is that wrong? or how to actually check for it?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Something odd is happening with this script and I don't know why, I tried to change from </p>

<pre><code>t+='&lt;td class=""days""&gt;'+x+'&lt;/td&gt;';
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>t+='&lt;td class=""days' + x +'""&gt;'+x+'&lt;/td&gt;';
</code></pre>

<p>this, so I could select each td, but when I do this a new td is generated which contains </p>

<pre><code>&lt;td id=""days&amp;lt;td class="" today=""""&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;

<p>I have NO idea why this happens, I just know it is messing with the code because afterwards I get a ""> printed (because of quotes mis-match caused by this new td...why is this happening?</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> that the production rules <code>S</code> and <code>X</code> will give me a string with two **<code>a</code>**s on both sides with as many **<code>b</code>**s in the middle as I'd like. However, I'm not sure how I can also put as many **<code>a</code>**s on both sides of the **<code>b</code>**s while making sure there are exactly the same number of **<code>a</code>**s on each side.</p>

<p>Any suggestions, solutions would be much appreciated. Thanks.</p>

"707491","1","707543","","2009-04-01 21:53:15","","21","1917","<p>I recently did some work modifying a Python gui app that was using wxPython widgets.  I've experimented with Python in fits and starts over last six or seven years, but this was the first time I did any work with a gui.  I was pretty disappointed at what seems to be the current state of gui programming with Python.  I like the Python language itself a lot, it's a fun change from the Delphi/ObjectPascal programming I'm used to, definitely a big productivity increase for general purpose programming tasks.   I'd like to move to Python for everything.</p>

<p>But wxPython is a huge step backwards from something like Delphi's VCL or .NET's WinForms.  While Python itself offers nice productivity gains from generally programming a higher level of abstraction, wxPython is used at a way lower level of abstraction than the VCL.  For example, I wasted a lot fo time trying to get a wxPython list object to behave the way I wanted it to.  Just to add sortable columns involved several code-intensive steps, one to create and maintain a shadow-data-structure that provided the actual sort order, another to make it possible to show graphic-sort-direction-triangles in the column header, and there were a couple more I don't remember.  All of these error prone steps could be accomplished simply by setting a property value using my Delphi grid component.</p>

<p>My conclusion: while Python provides big productivity gains by raising level of abstraction for a lot of general purpose coding, wxPython is several levels of abstraction <em>lower</em> than the gui tools available for Delphi.   Net result:  gui programming with Delphi is way faster than gui programming with Python, and the resulting ui with Delphi is still more polished and full-featured.  It doesn't seem to me like it's exaggerating to say that Delphi gui programming was more advanced back in 1995 than python gui programming with wxPython is in 2009.</p>

<p>I did some investigating of other python gui frameworks and it didn't look like any were substantially better than wxPython.  I also did some minimal investigation of gui formbuilders for wxPython, which would have made things a little bit better.  But by most reports those solutions are buggy and even a great formbuilder wouldn't address my main complaints about wxPython, which are simply that it has fewer features and generally requires you to do gui programming at a much lower level of abstraction than I'm used to with Delphi's VCL.  Some quick investigating into suggested python gui-dev solutions ( <a href=""http://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming</a> ) is honestly somewhat depressing for someone used to Delphi or .NET.</p>

<p>Finally, I've got a couple of questions.</p>

<p>First, am I missing something?  Is there some gui-development solution for Python that can compare with VCL or WinForms programming?   I don't necessarily care if it doesn't quite measure up to Delphi's VCL.  I'm just looking for something that's in the same league.</p>

<p>Second, could IronPython be the direction to go?  I've mostly tried to avoid drinking the .NET koolaid, but maybe IronPython gives me a reason to finally give in.  Even then, does IronPython fully integrate with WinForms, or would I need to have the forms themselves be backed by c# or vb.net?  It looks to me like that definitely is the case with SharpDevelop and MonoDevelop (i.e, IronPython can't be used to do design-time gui building).  Does VS.NET fully integrate IronPython with gui-building?</p>

<p>It really seems to me like Python could ""take over the world"" in a way similar to the way that Visual Basic did back in the early 1990's, if some wonderful new gui-building solution came out for Python.    Only this time with Python we'd have a whole new paradigm of fast, cross platform, and  <em>open source</em> gui programming.  Wouldn't corporations eat that up?  Yeah, I know, web apps are the main focus of things these days, so a great Python-gui solution wouldn't create same revolution that VB once did.  But I don't see gui programming disappearing and I'd like a nice modern, open source, high level solution.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT THE THIRD</strong>: My boss told me not to worry about it, that they can print from IE. I still want to figure this out.

<p>Suppose I have an object like this : </p>

<pre><code>public class TestObject
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And a view page (Create.aspx) like this : </p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""/Create"" method=""post""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;%=Html.TextBox(""Name"") %&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;%=Html.TextBox(""Age"")%&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And on my controller I have these actions : </p>

<pre><code>[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Get)]
public ActionResult Create()
{
    return View(new TestObject { Name = ""DefaultName"", Age = 10 } );
}

[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]
public ActionResult Create(TestObject o)
{
    o.Name = ""ChangedNameToSomethingElse"";
    o.Age = 15;
    return View(o);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Html.TextBox()</code> method always genereates the textboxes with the default values, even after the postback, where the object is passed back with different properties on its values. Now, granted, I can't think of a real world example why I'd want to do such a thing but I still don't understand why I always end up having textboxes populated with the model's values that were set on the Create action with the <code>AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Get)</code> attribute.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> : I've tried <code>Html.TextBox(""Name"", Model.Name)</code> but the result is still the same. And I verified that the Create action with <code>AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)</code> actually runs, by passing a value via ViewData to the View.
Also, the udated value is displayed when I output the value with <code>&lt;%=Model.Name %&gt;</code> but again, not on the textbox.</p>

<p>Is there something obvious I'm missing, or is there a reasoning behind this behaviour?</p>

Some of the things that I've come up with are:</p>

<li>Google -- if google can find it, an attacker can.

<li>Monitor traffic via a Sniffer -- Watch for a listing of pages that users go to.  This assumes some type of network access, in which case URL discovery is likely small peanuts given the fact the attacker has network access.

<p>Let us say that on my website, each user has their own folders that are not shared. I want their to be an option for each user on their account page in which they can create a trust with another user to access each others folders. Perhaps by typing in the name of the user in which they want to create a trust with. </p>

<p>So in this case, user Jim types into his create trust input box ""Tom"", and so a trust needs to be established. I figure, A) There will need to be something that stores Jim's request, B. then assigns it as unverified, C. and finally then sends the vaerification link to Tom. Tom then recieves a message somehow? (not sure yet), perhaps with something to check and see if there are any verification links for Tom? and then Tom clicks the verification link sent to verify that he wants to also establish a trust with Jim. once Tom clicks it, A. tells whatever it is that stored Jim's request that Tom accepted, B. assigns validation as verified C. notifies Jim that Tom's request has been accepted or declined.,</p>

<p>HOWEVER there also needs to be a way to remove the validation storage (whatever it will be) if 24 hours runs up, or Tom declines Jim's request.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/av4vO.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Using auto surrogate keys.</p>

<pre><code>=================   ==================
Road_Number(PK)     Segment_Number(PK)
=================   ==================
 1                   1
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Using program generated PK</p>

<pre><code>=================   ==================
Road_Number(PK)     Segment_Number(PK)
=================   ==================
 ""RD00000001WCK""     ""00000001.1""
</code></pre>

<p>(the <code>00000001.1</code> means it's the <strong>first</strong> segment of the road. This <em>increases</em> everytime you add a new segment e.g. <code>00000001.2</code>)</p>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Using a bit of both(adding a new column)</p>

<pre><code>=======================    ==========================
ID(PK) Road_Number(UK)     ID(PK)  Segment_Number(UK)
=======================    ==========================
 1     ""RD00000001WCK""       1       ""00000001.1""
</code></pre>

<p>Just a bit of background information, we will be using the <code>Road Number</code> and <code>Segment Number</code> in reports and other documents, so they have to be <strong>unique</strong>.   </p>

<p>I have always liked keeping things simple so I <em>prefer</em> example 1, but I have been reading that you should not expose your primary keys in reports/documents. So now I'm thinking more along the lines of example 3.  </p>

<p>I am also leaning towards example 3 because if we decide to change how our asset numbering is generated it won't have to do cascade updates on a primary key.</p>

<p>What do you think we should do?</p>

<p>The mapping I am using kindly creates an additional column in the database called Sector_Id in the Company table, but this is not available as a property on Company. I want the SectorID property to be filled.</p>

<pre><code>References(c =&gt; c.Sector).Cascade.All();

<p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks for your response.
Sadly if I do the second option (set the column name of the column to be the same as the property, or set <code>Map(x =&gt; x.SectorID, ""Sector_Id"")</code> then I get the error:</p>

<p>System.IndexOutOfRangeException: Invalid index 7 for this SqlParameterCollection with Count=7.</p>

<p>I may have to do the first option but I am concerned that an additional query will be fired when you call the SectorID get as it gets the Sector itself out of the db (unless it is eager loaded which is a bit of a hassle).</p>

<p>I am surprised there is not an easy answer to this. </p>

<hr>

<p>WOW!
If I use</p>

<pre><code>public virtual Guid SectorID
{
    get { return Sector.ID;
}

<p>then nhibernate is clever enough to know that the Sector_id column in the Organisation query is actually the same thing as Sector.ID and it returns this under the hoods. It does not send off an additional query even if you lazy load. I am impressed!</p>

<hr>

<p>As a follow up... It seems that hibernate is not really written to be able to map the foreign key column in the objects.  Although this can be a bit of a pain in web front ends it makes sense as this is really a persistence concern not really an object concern.
I am using asp.net MVC and have written a custom model binder that will take a input box of name Contact (rather than ContactID), new up a new Contact with the ID of what is in the texbox, and then apply this to the property of the Model.  This gets around the issue with dropdown lists in web front ends. Will post code if anyone is interested.</p>

  else:

<p>Or better, can you do all the cool stuff like in python or lisp?
Are there any limits?

<p>I see comparisons with null quite often in JS source. Why are they needed when all JS simple objects have known results when cast as booleans? </p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Larry</p>

<p>ps. I suppose if 0 (an integer) was a valid case, then if(0) would be false [a problem] and if(0 != null) would be true [allows the 0 case]. Any other reason?</p>

<p>pps. Should have mentioned that the tapeDiv is newly created. So there's no point to resetting the style to """" since the div is brand new.</p>

<pre><code>public static Func&lt;T&gt; WeakCacheFor&lt;T&gt;( Func&lt;T&gt; provider ) where T: class
{
    var cache = new WeakReference(null);
    return () =&gt; {
        var x = (T)cache.Target;
        if( x == null )
        {
            x = provider();
            cache.Target = x;
        }
        return x;
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>So a bit of background:</p>

<p>I have some long-winded legacy methods which look a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>var id = GetDatabaseId();
if(a){
    var data = GetLoader().Init(id).GetData(); // expensive!
    // do stuff with data
}
if(b){
    // don't load data
}
... lots more variations, some contain GetLoader().Init(id).GetData(); some don't....
</code></pre>

<p>My potential solution is to do this:</p>

<pre><code>var id = GetDatabaseId();
var loadData = WeakCacheFor(() =&gt; GetLoader().Init(id).GetData());
if(a){
    var data = loadData();
    // do stuff with data
}
if(b){
    // don't load data
}
... lots more variations, some contain loadData(); some don't....
</code></pre>

<p>My thoughts about this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't need to cache beyond the scope of this method call, so it's fine if the GC collects it as soon as the method returns</li>
<li>If the code takes a path which doesn't need to load the data, the hit won't be incurred</li>
<li>If it does need the data it will be cached in the weak reference if it's needed again.</li>
<li>If the GC does collect midway, it won't matter as it will just get re-loaded.</li>
</ul>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Will this actually work? - Is there anything that I've missed in the <code>WeakCacheFor</code> method that might cause a strong reference to inadvertenly be held?</li>
<li>Am I being too clever for my own good? - Should I just incur the hit and cache the data in a normal local variable even if it's not needed?</li>
</ol>

<p>I suspect I may be being too clever, but even if I am, does this seem to anyone else like a solution which can be usefully applied in other situations??</p>

<p>Update: Modified function because <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/clyon/archive/2006/04/20/580255.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">apparently you can't trust .IsAlive</a></p>

<p>Update: I realized that the returned <code>Func</code> will go out of scope at the end of the method, so I don't need a weakref at all and a normal ref will work just fine. I Was suffering from a case of ""can't see the forest for the trees"" I think.</p>

<p>I would like to know the process that Windows XP uses to determine the resolution to display at, and how it presents the user with a list of choices. This seems highly dependent on the video card manufacturer and driver.</p>

<p>I have observed wildly different behaviors on different systems:</p>

<ul>
<li>It seems that vanilla Windows XP does not query the EDID except at boot time, however laptops and custom video drivers sometimes seem to query the EDID at will (plug in a computer with no reboot, hit presentation mode, and the device name shows up)
</li>
<li>
Some PCs seem to have no trouble generating 848x480 or 800x480, but some just seem to ignore the detailed timings and fall back to a VESA 640x480. If you specify a custom timing mode, what is the chance that any given video driver/card will be able to generate the proper VGA signal?
</li>
<li>
 Often times, the EDID information will be transmitted to the system, but if you open the Windows display properties, and select the device in the settings tab, the slider of available modes does not show either 848x480 or 800x480. It usually just shows 640x480 among a list of other standard modes (but not the custom modes supplied).
</li>
<li>If this happens, then you can often get the device to display at 848x480 or 800x480 by selecting it in the list of all modes under display properties -> settings -> advanced -> adapter -> list all modes. When you select this, it switches to the proper resolution.
</li>
<li>
However, if you go back in to display properties -> settings, you will see the mode you selected in the slider, but the slider only has the one resolution. It should (at least) also show 640x480. Is this just a fact of life when dealing with Windows XP and non-standard video timings? It would be great to know exactly how Windows populates that slider.
</li>
</ul>

<p>I would greatly appreciate any resources that discuss the details associated with all of this.

  <p>Avoid passing the controller, action

{
    public static string Home(this UrlHelper helper)

<p>*Edit: This process is automated for many clients every night, so the whole process has to be kicked off and controlled within a cursor in a stored procedure. This is because the data has to be filtered per project for the export.</p>

<p>I have tried many ways to get data out of SQL into Access and the most promising has been using Access interop and running a </p>

<pre><code>doCmd.TransferDatabase(Access.AcDataTransferType.acImport...
</code></pre>

<p>I have hit a problem where I am importing from views, and running the import manually it seems the view does not start returning data fast enough, so access pops up a MessageBox dialog to say it has timed out. 
I think this is happening in interop as well, but because it is hidden the method never returns!</p>

<p>Is there any way for me to prevent this message from popping up, or increasing the timeout of the import command?</p>

<p>My current plan of attack is to flatten the view into a table, then import from that table, then drop the flattened table. </p>

<p>Happy for any suggestions how to tackle this problem.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Further info on what I am doing:</p>

<p>We have multiple clients which each have a standard data model. One of the 'modules' is a access exporter (sproc). It reads the views to export from a parameter table then exports. The views are filtered by project, and a access file is created for each project (every view has project field)</p>

<p>We are running SQL 2005 and are not moving to SQL 2005 quickly, we will probably jump to 2008 in quite a few months.</p>

<p>We then have a module execution job which executes the configured module on each database. There are many imports/exports/other jobs that run in this module execution, and the access exporter must be able to fit into this framework. So I need a generic SQL -> Access exporter which can be configured through our parameter framework.</p>

<p>Currently the sproc calls a exe I have written and my exe opens access via interop, I know this is bad for a server BUT the module execution is written so only a single module is executing at a time, so the procedure will never be running more than one instance at a time.</p>

For example we have a server application that still uses the Microsoft Fortran77 compiler. The less old parts of the application are written for the Visual Studio 6 C compiler and lately there have been runours of writing some new libraries with VS .Net 2008 C++. The programs/libraries have a number of different mechanisms to consume/communicate each other including static linking, shared memory (Windows memory mapped files), name pipes and TCP sockets.</p>

<p>What's to stop a C# application from being able to use any old library such as one of the Fortran77 ones written in a procedural langauge? </p>

<p>If my C# application understood the file format of a Fortan77 or C library and was able to locate the procedure call it wanted could it marshal the managed objects across, call the procedure and unmarshal the result? </p>

<p>If I copied a .so library file from Linux to Windows and my C# application understood the file format could it call functions from that library?</p>

<p>I think the answers are to do with the various Fortran, C etc. runtimes that are needed to initialise each library/program. If that's so then at a fundamental level are those runtimes the broadly similar to the CLR (realising they have different features such as memory management etc. etc. in the CLR's case)?</p>

LEFT JOIN table_b AS b ON (b.id = a.table_b_id)

<p>What I need is an associative array like this, 'bla'=>'bla'. What I am getting from my foreach loop is this from a print:</p>

<pre><code>[0] =&gt; Array
    (
        [0] =&gt; test0
        [name] =&gt; test0
        [1] =&gt; 1
        [customer_id] =&gt; 1
    )

[1] =&gt; Array
    (
        [0] =&gt; test
        [name] =&gt; test
        [1] =&gt; 2
        [customer_id] =&gt; 2
    )
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my loop:</p>

<pre><code>foreach($res as $key=&gt;$val)
{
  // have no idea..
}
</code></pre>

<p>Can someone please help me to format my results so that they are like 'index'=>'value'</p>

<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here is a sample code that uses a foreach but yet pulls an association. I don't get it. I am thinking that my result set with the indexes are because I am not writing the loop correctly. Here is the code that uses the foreach</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($items as $key=&gt;$value) {
    if (strpos(strtolower($key), $q) !== false) {
        echo ""$key|$value\n"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Here is the part of the database class that I am using to fetch the results.</p>

<pre><code>$returnArray = array();
$i=0;
while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result, MYSQL_BOTH)) {
    if($row)
        $returnArray[$i++] = $row;
}
mysql_free_result($result);
return $returnArray;
</code></pre>

<p>After using the code that was given to me to omit the index numbers, here is what I am now left with. Its close but not what I need.</p>

<p>Array
(
    [id] => 1
    [cust] => bobs auto
)</p>

<p>This is what the above line should read like</p>

<pre><code>'1' =&gt; 'bobs auto'
</code></pre>

<p>What I am trying to do is to format the output for a JSON call for a suggestion box.</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>I cannot get this to work. Here is everything after my db connection.</p>

<pre><code>$out_array = array();
foreach($items as $key=&gt;$val)
{
    if(is_int($key))
    {
      continue;
    }
    $out[$key['id']] = $val['cust'];
}



//echo'&lt;pre&gt;';
//print_r($out_array);
//echo'&lt;/pre&gt;';

foreach ($out_array as $key=&gt;$value) {
    if (strpos(strtolower($key), $q) !== false) {
        echo ""$key|$value\n"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>OK, I think I am coming down to the home stretch. I have what I need sort of. This is the code I have so far.</p>

<pre><code>$out_array = array();
foreach($items as $key)
{
    $out_array[$key] = $val;
//$out_array[$key['id']] = $key['cust'];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the commented line does not work, It outputs like the id twice but the line that isn't commented out works just fine. Here is the output from that.</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [8] =&gt; 
    [FAT BURGER] =&gt; 
)
</code></pre>

<p>From this point, would I just use another foreach to iterate over the entire set of data? The array output you see above is from a print_r.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is what I now have and it returns the correct association however, I must comment out the strpos condition to get any results back and I don't know why. Am I correct in nesting these foreach loops like I have?</p>

<pre><code>$out_array = array();
foreach($items as $key)
{
  //    $out_array[$key] = $val;
  $out_array[$key['id']] = $key['cust'];

  foreach ($out_array as $key=&gt;$value)
  {
      if (strpos(strtolower($key), $q) !== false)
      {
          echo ""$key|$value\n"";
      }
  }

}

<p>I'm writing a small web app to test the Khmer Unicode and Lao Unicode. I have a table that store text in Khmer Unicode with the following structure :</p>

<pre><code>[t_id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL
[t_chid] [int] NOT NULL
[t_vn] [int] NOT NULL
[t_v] [nvarchar](max) NOT NULL
</code></pre>

<p>I can use Linq to SQL to do CRUD normally. The text display properly on the web page, even though I didn't change the default collation of MSSQL Server 2008.</p>

<p>When it comes to search the column [t_v], the page will take a very long time to load and in fact, it loads every row of that column. It never compares with the ""key word"" criteria that I use for the search. Here's my query for the search :</p>

<pre><code>Public Shared Function SearchTestingKhmerTable(ByVal keyword As String) As DataTable

    Dim db As New BibleDataClassesDataContext()
    Dim query = From b In db.khmer_books _
                From ch In db.khmer_chapters _
                From v In db.testing_khmers _
                Where v.t_v.Contains(keyword) And ch.kh_book_id = b.kh_b_id And v.t_chid = ch.kh_ch_id _
                Select b.kh_b_id, b.kh_b_title, ch.kh_ch_id, ch.kh_ch_number, v.t_id, v.t_vn, v.t_v


    Dim dtDataTableOne = New DataTable(""dtOne"")
    dtDataTableOne.Columns.Add(""bid"", GetType(Integer))
    dtDataTableOne.Columns.Add(""btitle"", GetType(String))
    dtDataTableOne.Columns.Add(""chid"", GetType(Integer))
    dtDataTableOne.Columns.Add(""chn"", GetType(Integer))
    dtDataTableOne.Columns.Add(""vid"", GetType(Integer))
    dtDataTableOne.Columns.Add(""vn"", GetType(Integer))
    dtDataTableOne.Columns.Add(""verse"", GetType(String))

    For Each r In query
        dtDataTableOne.Rows.Add(New Object() {r.kh_b_id, r.kh_b_title, r.kh_ch_id, r.kh_ch_number, r.t_id, r.t_vn, r.t_v})
    Next
    Return dtDataTableOne


End Function
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that I use the exact same code and database design with Lao Unicode and it works just fine. I get the returned query as expected for the search. </p>

<p>I can't figure out what the problem with searching for query in Khmer table.</p>

<hr>

<p>I used the following Linq to join the table :    </p>

<pre><code>Dim query = From b In db.khmer_books _
    Join ch In db.khmer_chapters On b.kh_b_id Equals ch.kh_book_id _
    Join v In db.testing_khmers On ch.kh_ch_id Equals v.t_chid _

<p>My Game (play) would either create a MainMode object or a TestMode object depending on a boolean value (isMode). As you can see I am adding an extra value into my TestMode object (randNo()). This value is used within TestMode to allow the user to input their own ""Random Number"", whereas within the MainMode constructor this was randomly generated. In this program both MainMode and TestMode are sub-classes of the abstract class Game.</p>

<p>Now I want to replace this line with a Factory Pattern, although I am unsure as my TestMode constructor requires an extra object and I am unsure where I would need to pass this value. If I were going to create a Factory it'd need to be in a new class, probably named GameFactory or ModeFactory or something along those lines.</p>

<p>How would I go about this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The problem here is that the code above is in my GUI, where the values for numberRanges, numberOfGuesses and the randNo() method are. I want to create a Factory class but I am unable to pass these values through because randNo() activates itself. Here is my randNo() method.</p>

<pre><code>private int randNo() {
    boolean isValidNumber = true;
    int testRandomNum = 0;

        }
    }

    return testRandomNum;

<p>The problem is that whenever I pass randNo() it displays the JOptionPane. As I've said already the GUI and Logic is separate. The GUI is in a GUI package whilst the rest of the code is in the logic package.</p>

    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=""4""&gt;&lt;hr class=""contactSeparator""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So it alternates - chunk of contact info and then a ""contact separator"".  I want to grab the contact info so my first obstacle is to grab the chunks in between the contact separator.  I have already figured out the regular expression using rubular.  It is:</p>

<pre><code>/&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=""4""&gt;&lt;span class=""fullName""&gt;((.|\s)*?)&lt;hr class=""contactSeparator""&gt;/
</code></pre>

<p>You can check on rubular to verify that this isolates chunks.  </p>

<p>However my big issue is that I am having trouble with the ruby code.  I use the built in match function and make prints, but do not get the results I expect.  Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>page = agent.get uri.to_s    
chunks = page.body.match(/&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=""4""&gt;&lt;span class=""fullName""&gt;((.|\s)*?)&lt;hr class=""contactSeparator""&gt;/).captures

chunks.each do |chunk|
   puts ""new chunk: "" + chunk.inspect
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that page.body is just the body of the html document grabbed by Mechanize.  The html document is much larger but has this format.  So, the unexpected output is below:</p>

<pre><code>new chunk: ""Bill Gussio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n\t&lt;tr&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;td class=\""sectionHeader\""&gt;Contact&lt;/td&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;td class=\""sectionHeader\""&gt;Phone&lt;/td&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;td class=\""sectionHeader\""&gt;Home&lt;/td&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;td class=\""sectionHeader\""&gt;Work&lt;/td&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n\t&lt;tr valign=\""top\""&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;td class=\""sectionContent\""&gt;&lt;span&gt;Screen Name:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;bhjiggy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Email 1:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;wmgussio@erols.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;td class=\""sectionContent\""&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mobile: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;2404173223&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;td class=\""sectionContent\""&gt;&lt;span&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;New York&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;78642&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;td class=\""sectionContent\""&gt;&lt;span&gt;MD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Owings Mills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;21093&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n\t\r\n\t&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\""4\""&gt;""
new chunk: ""&gt;""
</code></pre>

<p>There are 2 surprises here for me:</p>

<p>1) There are not 2 matches that contain the chunks of contact info, even though on rubular I have verified that these chunks should be extracted.</p>

<p>2) All of the \r\n\t (line feeds, tabs, etc.) are showing up in the matches.</p>

<p>Can anyone see the issue here?</p>

<p>Alternatively, if anyone knows of a good free AOL contacts importer, that would be great.  I have been using blackbook but it keeps failing for me on AOL and I am attempting to fix it.  Unfortunately, AOL has no contacts API yet.</p>

<p>Essentially, I'm thinking of <code>xor</code>'ing the credit card information plus some message signature using a one time pad that's generated per client. This pad is stored as a cookie variable on the client's browser.
 Next time that user tries to place a purchase, the pad is sent to the server, and if the server can properly decode its encrypted data, it shows the credit card information as already being filled. (The cc info isn't actually transmitted back). The server will never store the pad in anything more than memory or page file. In fact, I intend to have the pad be sent twice: once upon arrival on the CC page (where the server checks if it should ask for CC information), and once on CC submission to get the actual information.</p>

<p>The user will also be instructed that their information is ""partially stored"" in their cookie cache, meaning that they will expect that if their cookies are flushed, their CC information is lost.</p>

<p><strong>script1.js:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var myValue = 1;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>script2.js:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var myValue = 2;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>script3.js:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var myValue = 3;
</code></pre>

<p>And I have one page, <strong>mypage.html</strong> that basically looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
   function get_number()
   {
     var script_file = GetQueryStringValue( ""run"" );
     e = document.createElement('script');
     e.type='text/javascript';
     e.src = script_file + "".js""
     head.appendChild( e );

     document.write( myValue );
   }
&lt;/script&gt;

   &lt;div onclick=""get_number()""&gt;Click me!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The main idea with this page is that you would query it like this:
    <code>mypage.html?run=script1</code>
which would tell the <code>get_number()</code> function to dynamically insert <code>script1.js</code> in to mypage.htm. Then, I call <code>get_number()</code> to display the value loaded from the script.</p>

<p>Now, I've stripped down the above to what I think are the relevant parts and I've left out a bunch of stuff, obviously. My actual code loads a large array of values and is more interesting... But, I'm hoping someone can help me out with this regardless.</p>

<p>What I'm finding is that in IE, the number displays correctly.</p>

<p>In Firefox, Chrome and Safari, I get an error that <code>myValue</code> is undefined. However, if I click the <code>Click me</code> div that I created, the number displays correctly. So, I know I'm correctly loading the javascript external file. But, it just isn't loaded in time for my <code>get_number()</code> function to work correctly <code>onload</code>.</p>

<p>Now, I hacked up my file a little so that the <code>get_number</code> function looks like this:</p>

<pre><code> function get_number()
 {

<p>The setTimeout delays enough for the DOM to be updated and the javascript to be loaded in most cases. But, this is a total hack. Firefox tends to load this 'improved' code correctly all the time while Chrome and Safari manage to get the value about 50% of the time.</p>

<p>So, I guess I'm wondering, is there a better way to accomplish what I'm trying to do here? It's very important that the value be driven externally (by the query string), but other than that requirement, I'm very flexible.</p>

<p>Has anyone used any open source or paid .NET Control which does the conversion job from html to pdf file? At the moment, i am using Winnovative convertor control. But it has a performance limitation during the generation of bulk pages (like more than 1000) in the pdf. The limitation comes when we use bigger images in the html content. From last 4 months i've been working on the winnovative control and found plenty of major bugs in it. For a small application and usage. winnovative is good but not for the level where application will be used by thousands of clients.</p>

<p>Please suggest.</p>

It doesn't do anything too tricky, with the exception that some background-image properties have the image directly embedded into the CSS (e.g. <code>background-image: url(""data:image/png;base64</code> ...), and commenting out those lines doesn't change the result.</p>

<p>More strangely (and I am not sure if this is relevant), was that I was having no problems with this last week. I came back to it this week and, after switching around some of the code that handles the to-be-injected HTML before actual injection, it no longer worked. Naturally I thought that one of my changes might somehow be the problem, but after commenting all that logic out and feeding it a straight string the HTML is still appearing unformatted.</p>

<p>At the moment I'm injecting into the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, though I've attempted to inject into <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and that's met with similar results.</p>

So what I do is when a new record is inserted/updated, I update the the parent record's <code>down_qty</code>, so this would trigger the update trigger recursively.</p>

<p>Right now, my code is ok - I put this on <code>UPDATE</code> trigger's first line:</p>

<pre><code>-- prevents recursive trigger
if new.track_recursive_trigger &lt;&gt; old.track_recursive_trigger then
    return new;
end if;
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the sample code from my trigger when I need to update the parent record's qty:</p>

<pre><code>update account_category set 
    track_recursive_trigger = track_recursive_trigger + 1, -- i put this line to prevent recursive trigger
    down_qty = down_qty - (old.down_qty + 1)
where account_category_id = m_parent_account;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm thinking if there's a way in PostgreSQL to detect recursive trigger without introducing a new field, something analogous to MSSQL's <code>trigger_nestlevel</code>.</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong></p>

<p>I loop inside the tree, I need to bubble up the <code>down_qty</code> of each <code>account_category</code> back to its root.  For example, I insert a new account category, it needs to increment the <code>down_qty</code> of its parent <code>account_category</code>, likewise when I change the account category's parent <code>account_category</code>, I need to decrement the <code>down_qty</code> of <code>account_category</code>'s previous parent <code>account_category</code>.  Though I think it can, I'm not letting PostgreSQL do the recursive trigger.  I used MSSQL before where the trigger recursive depth level is limited only up to <code>16</code> levels.</p>

<p>In most cases with SQL there are several ways to structure a given query, even using the same dialect. But I find it interesting that the relative portability of various approaches is frequently not discussed, nor valued very highly when  it is.</p>

<p>But even disregarding the likelihood that any given application may or not be subject to conversion, I'd think that we would prefer that our skills, habits, and patterns be as portable as possible.</p>

you search for keywords, it brings up a list of potential titles matching your search.
</li>
<li>
then you pick one of these and it provides you with another list of potential servers hosting the corresponding torrent file.

<p>What I'm interested in particularly is the strategy behind gathering and indexing all that content:</p>

<p><b>How do they collect then aggregate the data?</b>
<br/>Is it a submission base service, where each of these servers submits its content for indexing?
<br/>Is it a crawling algorithm? If so how do you even start crawling a site like piratebay.org?
<br/>Do they have access to these other servers' databases?</p>

<p>My knowledge and understanding of the bittorrent protocol is not very elaborate, but the documentation that I found online pointed me more toward the processes involved in building a tracker service, which isn't exactly what I'm interested in.

I have tried to run my app on another PC: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>same OS (Windows XP) </p></li>
<li><p>same JRE (1.6.0_U13)</p></li>
<li><p>but Oracle JInitiator 1.3.1.18 installed (this is the only difference with my PC)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The app works fine only from command line, but not from gui!</p>

<p>Double-clicking over the .jar file I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>`Could not find the main class. program will exit!`
</code></pre>

<p>Can this error be due to some conflict between JRE and JInitiator?</p>

<p>Does anybody had the same trouble?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<hr>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>executing .jar files from gui is associated to the ""javaw"" command</p>

<p>Such managers believe that processes and methodologies completely solve the problem and I have a tough time explaining to them that it is not so and that you cannot read a book on the latest process fad and hope to get results by applying them as is.</p>

<p>The latest frustration I have is to convince my manager to 
(a) Give me requirements not piece-meal but a larger set as far as possible.
(b) Give my team lead time to think about how to design, thrash out a few alternatives, work out an implementation sketch, to plan out the tasks etc.</p>

<p>The frustrations are compounded because of Agile methodology and the interpretation of it that says not to do up-front design (as against BIG up-front design in Waterfall), product owner can change requirements at any time and so son.</p>

<p>So far I haven't had much success and have to put up with the resulting frustrations.
Can you give me some arguments that can convince such managers?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT-1</strong>:
Retrospectives are done, though not always at the end of every sprint, and the problems are brought up. But as I mentioned, my manager doesn't appreciate the need for design lead time and the frustrations with piece-meal requirements.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT-2</strong>
I don't have a problem with changing requirements. I understand that it will be so, but imagine this: You want a small feature to begin with and then you keep adding more around it. After a few iterations, the design cannot handle it anymore and a redesign (not refactoring) is required. This could have been solved better with an upfront design in the first place, had the related features been investigated together. Its not BDUF, its the natural way of doing it (what I call software engineering common sense).</p>

<p>My manager doesn't understand why I ask for time to redesign (a few times I just call it refactoring so that it fits the Agile way of doing it, but it really is redesign) and not developing and demoing new features.</p>

<p>This is not homework or an assignment of any kind. The example classes have been created to better illustrate my question however it does reflect a real life scenario which we would like feedback on.</p>

<p>We retrieve all data from the database and place it into an object. A object represents a single record and if multiple records exist in the database, we place the data into a List&lt;> of the record object.</p>

<p>Lets say we have the following classes;</p>

<pre><code>    public class Employee
    {
        public bool _Modified;
        public string _FirstName;
        public string _LastName;
        public List&lt;Emplyee_Address&gt; _Address;
    }

    public class Employee_Address
    {
        public bool _Modified;
        public string _Address;
        public string _City;
        public string _State;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that the Getters and Setters have been omitted from the classes for the sake of clarity. Before any code police accuse me of not using them, please note that have been left out for this example only.</p>

<p>The database has a table for Employees and another for Employee Addresses.</p>

<p>Conceptually, what we do is to create a List object that represents the data in the database tables. We do a deep clone of this object which we then bind to controls on the front end. We then have two objects (Orig and Final) representing data from the database.</p>

<p>The user then makes changes to the ""Final"" object by creating, modifying, deleting records. We then want to persist these changes to the database.</p>

<p>Obviously we want to be as elegant as possible, only editing, creating, deleting those records that require it. </p>

<p>We ultimately want to compare the two List objects so that we can; </p>

<ol>
<li><p>See what properties have changed so that the changes can be persisted to the database.  </p></li>
<li><p>See what properties (records) no longer exist in the second List&lt;> so that these records can be deleted from the database.  </p></li>
<li><p>See what new properties exist in the new List&lt;> so that we can create these in the database.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Who wants to get the ball rolling on how we can best achieve this. Keep in mind that we also need to drill down into the Employee_Address list to check for any changes, not just the top level properties.</p>

<p>I hope I have made myself clear and look forward to any suggestions.</p>

<p>Hi, i was just wondering if someone could help me with a method to determine which button number has been pressed, then i can send this value to another method in order to display an appropriate image, all ideas are welcome, though could you please try to avoid complete  code as much as possible as i want to try and do it myself, examples would be nice tho</p>

<p>thank you</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/685162/how-much-traffic-can-shared-web-hosting-take"">How Much Traffic Can Shared Web Hosting Take?</a></p>

<p>stated that a $5/mo shared hosting account on Reliablesite.net can support 10,000 - 20,000 unique users/day and 100,000 - 200,000 pageviews/day. 
That seems awfully high for a $5/mo account. And someone else told me it's far less than that. What's your experience?</p>

<p>I have a site based on Python, Django, MySQL/Postgresql. It doesn't have any video or other bandwidth heavy elements, but the whole site is dynamic, each page takes about 5 to 10 DB query, 90% reads, 10% writes.</p>

<p>Reliablesite.net is an ASP.NET hosting company. Any Python/LAMP hosting firm that can support 100-200,000 pageviews on a shared hosting account? If not, what kind of numbers am I looking at? Any suggestions for good hosting firms?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>For the optimization itself, I'll have to work very intensively on a small subset of the data (about 600 rows total from about 5 different tables).

<p>Now, while searching and iteration are exactly what a DBMS is for, I believe that in this case the overhead of hundreds of DB requests would dwarf the actual work being done, even for an in-memory DBMS like HSQLDB. So instead, I'm planning to slurp the entire subset into memory at the beginning, build my own indexes (HashMap, mainly) for the lookups I'll have to do, and then work only with those, staying away from the DB until I'm done and write my result to it.</p>

<p>If you want to <code>switch</code> on a type of object, what is the best way to do this?</p>

<h3>Code snippet</h3>

<pre><code>private int GetNodeType(NodeDTO node)
{
    switch (node.GetType())
    { 
        case typeof(CasusNodeDTO):
            return 1;
        case typeof(BucketNodeDTO):
            return 3;
        case typeof(BranchNodeDTO):
            return 0;
        case typeof(LeafNodeDTO):
            return 2;
        default:
            return -1;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know this doesn't work that way, but I was wondering how you could solve this.
Is an <code>if/else</code> statement appropriate in this case?</p>

<p>Or do you use the switch and add <code>.ToString()</code> to the type?</p>

<p>The idea is that consuming applications can POST XML directly and benefit from better validation etc., but there's also an HTML interface that will POST the form-encoded stuff.  Obviously the XML format has a charset declaration, but I can't see how I detect the form's charset just from looking at the POST.</p>

<p>A typical post to the form from Firefox looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>POST /path HTTP/1.1
Host: www.myhostname.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 [...etc...]
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml, [...etc...]
Accept-Language: en-gb,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
Keep-Alive: 300
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 41

field1=value1&amp;field2=value2&amp;field3=value3
</code></pre>

<p>Which doesn't seem to contain any useful indication of the character set.</p>

<p>From what I can see, the application/x-www-form-urlencoded type is entirely defined in HTML, which just lays out the %-encoding rules, but doesn't say anything about what charset the data should be in.</p>

<p>Basically, is there any way of telling the character set if I don't know the character set the HTML originally presented was?  Otherwise I'll have to try and guess the character set based on what chars are present, and that's always a bit iffy from what I can tell.</p>

I don't have a problem with the programming in itself, but I'm a bit unsure about some of the math, and would like confirmation/corrections from someone a bit more knowledgable.</p>

<p>The assignment starts with a abstract class, GeometricObject, which is extended into three two-dimensional objects. A rectangle, a circle and a triangle. Those three are then extended into a cuboid for the rectangle, a cylinder and a sphere for the circle, and the triangle into a triangular prism.</p>

<p>Each of these three-dimensional objects are hollow, and has a defined thickness and is made of a special metal, so we are to calculate their weight. And herein lies the problem, since I'm a bit unsure as to how I find the ""inner volume"" on some of them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cuboid: Here I assume that I can just subtract 2 * thickness from the width, height and depth, and then everything looks fine.</li>
<li>Cylinder: Subtract thickness from the radius making up the base, and 2*thickness from the height</li>
<li>Sphere: Subtract thickness from the radius</li>
<li>Prism: This is where I'm a bit stuck. Each object gets passed a baseline, height of the triangle, and the height for the entire prism. How can I use this in order to find the ""inner prism"" representing the inner volume?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Update</em>: Forgot to mention that when creating the object, we specify the outmost sizes, and the hollow part is inside of this. The other way around is not allowed.</p>

<p><em>Update again</em>: The triangle is an isosceles triangle.</p>

<p><em>Update yet again</em>: Mixed up radius and diameter for the circular. Corrected now.</p>

Because in my project I need to compare this iterator with zero only and not with alist.end()..
What may be the probable solution to this...?</p>

<p>The Windows Java program (let's call it <code>W</code>) opens a listen socket to a port given by the OS, say 1234 to receive results.  Then it invokes a ""dispatch"" service on the server with a ""business request"". This service splits the request and sends it to other servers (let's call them <code>S1 ... Sn</code>), and returns the number of jobs to the client synchronously.</p>

<p>In my tests, there are 13 jobs, dispatched to a number of servers and within 2 seconds, all servers have finished processing their jobs and try to send the results back to the <code>W</code>'s socket.</p>

<p>I can see in the logs that 9 jobs are received by <code>W</code> (this number varies from test to test). So, I try to look for the 4 remaining jobs.  If I do a <code>netstat</code> on this Windows box, I see that 4 sockets are open:</p>

<pre><code>TCP    W:4373       S5:48197  ESTABLISHED
TCP    W:4373       S5:48198  ESTABLISHED
TCP    W:4373       S6:57642  ESTABLISHED
TCP    W:4373       S7:48295  ESTABLISHED
</code></pre>

<p>If I do a thread dump of <code>W</code>, I see 4 threads trying to read from these sockets, and apparently stuck in <code>java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method)</code>.  </p>

<p>If I go on each of the <code>S</code> boxes and do a <code>netstat</code>, I see that some bytes are still in the Send Queue. This number of bytes does not move for 15 minutes. (The following is the aggregation of <code>netstat</code>s on the different machines):</p>

<pre><code>Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address               Foreign Addr   State
tcp        0   6385 S1:48197                          W:4373   ESTABLISHED
tcp        0   6005 S1:48198                          W:4373   ESTABLISHED
tcp        0   6868 S6:57642                          W:4373   ESTABLISHED
tcp        0   6787 S7:48295                          W:4373   ESTABLISHED
</code></pre>

<p>If I do a thread dump of the servers, I see the threads are also stuck in 
<code>java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method)</code>.  I would expect a write, but maybe they're waiting for an ACK? (Not sure here; would it show in Java? Shouldn't it be handled by the TCP protocol directly?)</p>

<p>Now, the very strange thing is: after 15 minutes (and it's always 15 minutes), the results are received, sockets are closed, and everything continues as normal. </p>

<p>This used to always work before. The <code>S</code> servers moved to a different data center, so <code>W</code> and <code>S</code> are no longer in the same data center. Also, <code>S</code> is behind a firewall. All ports should be authorized between <code>S</code> and <code>W</code> (I'm told). The mystery is really the 15 minute delay. I thought that it could be some protection against DDOS?</p>

<p>I'm no network expert so I asked for help, but nobody's available to help me. I spent 30 minutes with a guy capturing packets with Wireshark (formerly Ethereal), but for ""security reasons,"" I cannot look at the result. He has to analyze this and get back to me. I asked for the firewall logs; same story.</p>

<p>Doing this on the processor (GDI etc.) steals way too much performance. For example it takes us 0.2 seconds to analyse the image but 0.8 seconds to show it with a single zoom (resized to fit some control), let alone let the user move on and dive into it.</p>

<p>Since Photoshop allows to show and zoom by the help of the graphic card's very fast memory and processing I wondered if anyone can give me an idea if and how I can experiment on this in my own code:
push data to graphic card (how long may this take for my 76MB of rgb-data?) and let it show in some control without much effort to zoom and move in it by user  to the control/card for user interaction.</p>

<p>No need for 3D looks, just moving and resizing in a 2D-rgb-image. 
Aim is to enable fast and comfortable viewing with low processor load. </p>

This has the advantage that in many cases they can be treated in the same way. However, there is an important semantic difference between the two, since for an iterable <code>__iter__</code> returns a new iterator object and not just <code>self</code>. How can I test that an iterable is really an iterable and not an iterator? Conceptually I understand iterables to be collections, while an iterator only manages the iteration (i.e. keeps track of the position) but is not a collection itself.</p>

<p>The difference is for example important when one wants to loop multiple times. If an iterator is given then the second loop will not work since the iterator was already used up and directly raises <code>StopIteration</code>.</p>

<p>It is tempting to test for a <code>next</code> method, but this seems dangerous and somehow wrong. Should I just check that the second loop was empty?</p>

<p>Is there any way to do such a test in a more pythonic way? I know that this sound like a classic case of LBYL against EAFP, so maybe I should just give up? Or am I missing something?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
S.Lott says in his answer below that this is primarily a problem of wanting to do multiple passes over the iterator, and that one should not do this in the first place. However, in my case the data is very large and depending on the situation has to be passed over multiple times for data processing (there is absolutely no way around this).</p>

<p>The iterable is also provided by the user, and for situations where a single pass is enough it will work with an iterator (e.g. created by a generator for simplicity). But it would be nice to safeguard against the case were a user provides only an iterator when multiple passes are needed.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong>
Actually this is a very nice Example for <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119/#abcs-for-containers-and-iterators"" rel=""noreferrer"">Abstract Base Classes</a>. The <code>__iter__</code> methods in an iterator and an iterable have the same name but are sematically different! So <code>hasattr</code> is useless, but <code>isinstance</code> provides a clean solution.</p>

<p><a href=""http://pixel8.infragistics.com/default.aspx#Episode:11933"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Implementing Model-View-ViewModel in WPF</a></p>

<p>What amazes me about these is <strong>how different they are structurally</strong>, for instance, how they use DataBinding:</p>

<p>In the Silverlight approach, we <strong>set the DataContext of a <em>View</em> to an <em>ObservableCollection</em> in the ViewModel</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;views:QuestionView x:Name=""QuestionDataView"" /&gt;

QuestionViewModel qdata = new QuestionViewModel();
qdata.FetchQuestions();
QuestionDataView.DataContext = qdata.Questions;
</code></pre>

<p>In the WPF approach, we <strong>set the DataContext of the <em>Window</em> to the <em>ViewModel</em> itself</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;view:QuizView Margin=""4"" /&gt;

base.DataContext = new QuizViewModel(Quiz.Create());
</code></pre>

<p>It just seems that every MVVM example I look at does DataContext binding in a slightly new variation and I'm <strong>trying to nail down</strong> some solid ground as to ""<strong>how DataContext binding is done in the MVVM pattern</strong>"". </p>

<p>What goes through your head when you decide to bind the DataContext to something: why bind the DataContext of a <strong>Window / View / ListBox / etc.</strong> to a <strong>ObservableCollection / ModelView / etc.</strong>? What are the advantages, disadvantages, strategies here? </p>

<p>Any input appreciated.</p>

"709162","1","709436","","2009-04-02 10:24:33","","0","1796","<p>Firstly, bear with me here. I have a custom model binder which is successfully mapping form data to a custom object. Within this model binder it also maps form items to different custom object. What I feel I should be able to do is create a separate model binder to take care of this second mapping. This is a simplified version.</p>

<p>Custom objects:</p>

<pre><code>public class Category
{
    public int CategoryId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Status { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable&lt;SubCategory&gt; SubCategories { get; set; }
}

public class SubCategory
{
    public int CategoryId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public string Status { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If my form passes back a bunch of Ids for the SubCategories, what I need to do is run off to the data repository and hydrate the SubCategory object. From the form, a list of subcategories would be submitted in the following format:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text"" name=""Name"" value=""This Category"" /&gt;

&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""subcat.Index"" value=""0"" /&gt;
&lt;select name=""subcat[0].Id""&gt;
    &lt;option value=""1""&gt;Something&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""2""&gt;Something else&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;

&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""subcat.Index"" value=""1"" /&gt;
&lt;select name=""subcat[1].Id""&gt;
    &lt;option value=""1""&gt;Something&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""2""&gt;Something else&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;

&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""subcat.Index"" value=""2"" /&gt;
&lt;select name=""subcat[2].Id""&gt;
    &lt;option value=""1""&gt;Something&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""2""&gt;Something else&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Writing a custom to map the Category is obviously simple, writing the model binder which will in turn map the SubCategory (within the model binder I would run off an query my data repository) is proving a little difficult.</p>

<p>I am not sure how clear I have made this, apologies, thanks for reading and please let me know if there is something I can say to make this clearer!</p>

<p>I also have a silverlight application that queries the WCF server. I access the service through a service reference.  When I execute the silverlight code in VS2008 it connects fine to the server.  When I host the site on a local IIS server (even 5.1) it works fine.</p>

<p>However, when I move my site to our official IIS server, the client dies when it tries to connect to the server.  Initially it did not work at all, then we had the MIME types added. Although, currently, I think the MIME type for .xap is still set to application/octet-stream. (Don't know if it really makes a difference, since the site gets downloaded now.)</p>

<p>I checked the packets going in and out of the browser, and it seems that the client crashes every time I try to establish a connection to the server (I believe it takes place when it instantiates the connection code, before even sending a packet.) I know the IIS server can see the WCF Service, since I tested retrieving data from the service using ASP.NET.</p>

<p>Other than installing the SDK on that IIS, I can think of nothing else to try.  Anyone have any ideas?</p>

Because of these problems, I'm looking for recommendations for an alternative HTML parser I could use to perform the operations.</p>

<p>Here's my situation, I have span tags in my html (with an ID attribute to identify them) and I simply want to replace their contents based on an update in another area of my client.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;span id=""1""&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; you are &lt;span id=""2""&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I've been trying to use the <code>HTMLDocument</code> class in <code>javax.swing.text</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>Element e;
e = doc.getElement(document.getDefaultRootElement(), Attribute.ID, ""1"");
document.setInnerHTML(element, ""John"");
e = doc.getElement(document.getDefaultRootElement(), Attribute.ID, ""2"");
document.setInnerHTML(element, ""99"");
</code></pre>

<p>but the element returned is a leaf element and won't allow the innerHTML to be set. Unfortunately, the document, reader &amp; parser are all supplied by a 3rd party &amp; so I can't really modify it.</p>

<p>So, what I was hoping for was that someone else has had a similar problem and could recommend an alternative library to do this?</p>

"709308","1","710028","","2009-04-02 11:17:40","","5","931","<p>I have an application that streams through 250 MB of data, applying a simple and fast neural-net threshold function to the data chunks (which are just 2 32-bit words each). Based on the result of the (very simple) compute, the chunk is unpredictably pushed into one of 64 bins.  So it's one big stream in and 64 shorter (variable length) streams out.</p>

<p>This is repeated many times with different detection functions.</p>

<p>The compute is memory bandwidth limited. I can tell this because there's no speed change even if I use a discriminant function that's much more computationally intensive.</p>

<p><strong>What is the best way to structure the writes of the new streams to optimize my memory bandwidth?</strong> I am especially thinking that understanding cache use and cache line size may play a big role in this. Imagine the worst case where I have my 64 output streams and by bad luck, many map to the same cache line. Then when I write the next 64 bits of data to a stream, the CPU has to flush out a stale cache line to main memory, and load in the proper cache line. Each of those uses 64 BYTES of bandwidth... so my bandwidth limited application may be wasting 95% of the memory bandwidth (in this hypothetical worst case, though).</p>

<p>It's hard to even try to measure the effect, so designing ways around it is even more vague. Or am I even chasing a ghost bottleneck that somehow the hardware optimizes better than I could?</p>

<p>I'm using Core II x86 processors if that makes any difference.</p>

<p>Edit: Here's some example code. It streams through an array and copies its elements to various output arrays picked pseudo-randomly.  Running the same program with different numbers of destination bins gives different runtimes, even though the same amount of computation and memory reads and writes were done:</p>

<p>2 output streams: 13 secs<br>
8 output streams: 13 secs<br>
32 output streams: 19 secs<br>
128 output streams: 29 seconds<br>
512 output streams: 47 seconds</p>

<p>The difference between using 512 versus 2 output streams is 4X, (probably??) caused by cache line eviction overhead.</p>

<p>I have a nonclustered index on this table with the columns <code>iBatchNumber</code>, <code>sFieldName</code>, <code>sTableName</code>, <code>iRowIndex</code>. And that index has <code>sFieldValue</code> as an included column.</p>

<hr>

<p>As Quassnoi suggested (and I think I understand why now) I have changed the index to have the columns in this order: <code>iBatchNumber</code>, <code>sTableName</code>, <code>iRowIndex</code>, <code>sFieldName</code>. And I use <code>sFieldValue</code> as an included column. The execution plan does not contain any <code>SORT</code> anymore, and the number of steps in the execution plan is less than half of original, which I hope is also faster...</p>

It's also imperative that it's as transparent as possible.</p>

<p>My solution to this in the C code of the engine is having the <code>printf</code> function inside a <code>vararg</code> macro, and defining that to do nothing in a release build.</p>

<p>As I understand it, in CL strings and lists are both sequences, but there don't seem to be any standard functions for mapping over a sequence, only lists.  I can see why they would be supplied for lists, what with them being the fundamental datatype and all, but why was it not designed to work with sequences?  As they are a more general type, it would seem more useful to target applicative functions at them rather than lists.  Or am I completely misunderstandimatifying how it works?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>What I was feeling particularly confused about was the way that sequences -- the abstraction -- and lists -- an implementation -- seem to be muddled up in CL.  The consensus seems to be that this is for historical reasons; lisp has been around so long that you can pretty much map out the development of software engineering practices through its functions and macros; which functions apply to sequences and which to lists seems arbitrary at first glance because CL has a mixture of pre-sequence-abstraction functions that operate only on lists, and functions that do the same thing in a more general way on sequences.  As someone who is just learning CL at the moment, I think it would be useful if authors introduced sequences first as the cleaner abstraction, and then bought in lists as the most fundamental implementation of that abstraction.  Lists would still be needed as syntax of course, but by the time it is necessary to state this explicitly many readers would have worked this out by themselves, which would be quite an ego boost when starting out.</p>

It looks like granting / revoking ""read access"" to parts of the documentation for our external users - customers, project partners - is not easy to achieve. How could we control read access to some areas of the documentation based on user or role access rights?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I am asking this because I don't like to go back to the ""old style"" of documentation - storing Office documents in dozens of different locations, and nobody has a clue where they are. So if there is no way to give users limited access only to their product information, I am afraid that management will drop the whole MediaWiki solution and introduce something ""new and better"". (this could mean we have to transfer all content to a new system, formatting and hyperlinks would be lost etc. ...).</p>

In the driver code I open the USB handles for the devices which match the VID and the PID which match my HID device and then set up an Interrupt call back for it using setInterruptReportHandlerCallback function and then add it to the CFRunLoop using CFRunLoopAddSource call. In my call to the close handles I freed them up using CFRunLoopRemoveSource and then a CFRelease on the CFRunLoopSourceRef .</p>

<p>The problem occurs when I try to Open the handles wait for a while( 5ms) and then close the handles in a loop.</p>

<p>When I searched for the problem I came across a link where they had a similar problem to mine <a href=""http://lists.apple.com/archives/usb/.../msg00099.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://lists.apple.com/archives/usb/.../msg00099.html</a> where they had used CFRunLoopSourceInvalidate call instead of teh Remove Source call. When I changed it to Invalidate source in my close handles call, it fixed my crash. I wanted to know what is the difference between the crash and why this call fixed my crash?</p>

<p>I have spent a few weeks putting together a basic web site which uses Facebook connect as authentication.</p>

<p>I have studied 'theRunAround', the provided example application. However the code is convoluted and uses a large number of files and classes, most of which have a lot of functionality that I have no need for. I have also had a good read of the documentation.</p>

<p>My code works <em>almost</em> all the time. However, occasionally I receive strange, <strong>unpredictable</strong> errors.</p>

<ul>
<li>Check if user is already logged in to Facebook, if so, retrieve the fb_uid, name, profile pic</li>
<li>Return a list of friends which have also connected to this application</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any tutorials, better than the ones provided by Facebook regarding such simple functionality?</p>

"709617","1","","","2009-04-02 13:04:57","","4","5423","<p>I'm trying to re-use my ASP User Controls in other projects, and have hit upon a problem. I've read ScottGu's post on <a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/08/28/423888.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/08/28/423888.aspx</a> and tried to follow his patterns but run-time the child controls of my controls are not being initialised.</p>

<p>My setup: 
I'm using Visual Studio 2008 
I've created a solution to hold the controls I want to distribute to several other solutions. This solution contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>library projects (for model code, etc.), let's call this <em>""ClassLibrary""</em></li>
<li>a WebApp project (with my User Controls), let's call this <em>""Innermost""</em></li>
<li>a number of other WebApp projects acting as Shells for the Innermost project, let's regard one of them and call it <em>""Outer""</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The thought behind this is that Innermost contains the functionality and Outer contains any special modifications needed to make Innermost -controls work in a particular framework.</p>

<p>The ClassLibrary has code like this (this is all from a demo-setup I made to make sure it was an ASP issue, not something else I was doing):</p>

<pre><code>using System;

namespace ClassLibrary {
    public class LibraryClass {
        public long getLong() {
            return DateTime.Now.Ticks;
        }

        public string getString() {
            return DateTime.Now.ToString();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Innermost references the library project and works fine. This is an example of a UserControl in this project:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Control Language=""C#"" AutoEventWireup=""true"" 
    CodeBehind=""WebUserControl1.ascx.cs"" 
    Inherits=""Innermost.UserControls.WebUserControl1"" %&gt;
&lt;asp:Label ID=""testLabel"" runat=""server""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>with code-behind: </p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Web.UI;
using ClassLibrary;

namespace Innermost.UserControls {
    public partial class WebUserControl1 : UserControl {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
            LibraryClass c = new LibraryClass();
            testLabel.Text = ""Your number is "" + c.getLong();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have a test page in the Innermost project which uses the User Controls of the Innermost project by registering them with the following syntax:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Page Language=""C#"" AutoEventWireup=""true"" CodeBehind=""Test1.aspx.cs"" 
    Inherits=""Innermost.Test1"" %&gt;

&lt;%@ Register TagPrefix=""inner"" TagName=""Control1"" 
    Src=""~/UserControls/WebUserControl1.ascx"" %&gt;
&lt;%@ Register TagPrefix=""inner"" TagName=""Control2""
    Src=""~/UserControls/WebUserControl2.ascx"" %&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" 
    ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""&gt;
&lt;head runat=""server""&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form id=""form1"" runat=""server""&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Control 1:
    &lt;inner:Control1 ID=""control1"" runat=""server"" /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    Control 2:
    &lt;inner:Control2 ID=""control2"" runat=""server"" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The Outer project references Innermost and ClassLibrary; and contains UserControls with the following registering of the Innermost controls:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Control Language=""C#"" AutoEventWireup=""true"" 
    CodeBehind=""TopControl.ascx.cs"" Inherits=""Outer.Control.TopControl"" %&gt;
&lt;%@ Register TagPrefix=""inner"" Assembly=""Innermost""
    Namespace=""Innermost.UserControls"" %&gt;
&lt;inner:WebUserControl1 ID=""Control1"" runat=""server""/&gt;
&lt;inner:WebUserControl2 ID=""Control2"" runat=""server""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With a simple code-behind:
    using System;
    using System.Web.UI;</p>

<pre><code>namespace Outer.Control {
    public partial class TopControl : UserControl {
        public bool ShowType1 { get; set; }

        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
            Control1.Visible = ShowType1;
            Control2.Visible = !ShowType1;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I run the test-page in the Innermost project I get no errors, and everything works. When I run the Outer project I get <code>NullReferenceException</code>s telling me that the child controls of the <code>Innermost.UserControls.WebUserControlX</code> have not been set.</p>

<p>StackTrace:</p>

<pre><code>[NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.]
   Innermost.UserControls.WebUserControl1.Page_Load(Object sender, EventArgs e) in c:\Test\ASP\Innermost\Innermost\UserControls\WebUserControl1.ascx.cs:9

   System.Web.UI.Control.LoadRecursive() +141
   System.Web.UI.Page.ProcessRequestMain(Boolean includeStagesBeforeAsyncPoint, Boolean includeStagesAfterAsyncPoint) +627
</code></pre>

<p>I can provide the test setup as solutions if anyone wants to have a closer look at this.</p>

<p>So, finally, my question is: Why do the ChildControls of the controls not get set up as expected? Even if I run <code>CreateChildControls()</code> in the Init of the outer controls they aren't being created. Is there some particular way I need to compile the Innermost project for use in the Outer project?</p>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated!</p>

<p>I have an autosuggest box that is getting my results from a database and populating the textbox just fine. When I designed this about 6 months ago, I was searching the database on the value rather than the key value. This is a problem today and needs to be fixed.</p>

<p>WHat the ajax has returned to my script is the key/value pair. Now that I have the id, I need to pass that into my php method so I can process it from there.</p>

<p>Can somone please give me a hand with this? It seems simple enough but again, javascript was never my thing so I am lost.</p>

<p>Here is all of the relevant code. Also, I don't think, at least from the code samples I have seen so far that I even need a form tag. Am I correct on this? Ideally, I want to submit the found ajax value with the enter button and NOT using a button.</p>

<p>So, just to clarify, this is what happens. The user types 2 or 3 letters. The ajax queries the db on a ""LIKE"" operator and returns the matches. The user chooses the one he wants and then the id goes out to my method and returns the exact record in a different window.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method=""post"" class=""hdrForm"" id=""search"" action=""../../index.php?cer=2"" target=""_top""&gt;
&lt;input type=""text"" name=""string"" class=""hdrInput"" id=""string"" value=""Quick Search""&gt;&lt;div id=""acDiv""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Note.. I need the ""id"" in this function to be submitted. Right now, I am getting the POST val off the form tag and that's not correct but how?</p>

<pre><code>  AC.chooseFunc = function(id,label)
  {
    document.forms.search.submit();
  }
</code></pre>

I then loop through each of the Ext.data.Record objects, placing the data I need into an array (<code>this_column</code>), push that array onto the end of another array (<code>columns</code>), and eventually pass this to an Ext.grid.ColumnModel object.</p>

<p>The problem I am having is - no matter which query I am testing against (I have a number of them, varying in size and complexity), the columns array always works as expected up to <code>columns[15]</code>. At <code>columns[16]</code>, all indexes from that point and previous are filled with the value of <code>columns[15]</code>. This behavior continues until the loop reaches the end of the Ext.data.Store object, when the entire arrays consists of the same value.</p>

<p>Here's some code:</p>

<pre><code>columns = [];
this_column = [];

var MetaData = Ext.data.Record.create([
    {name: 'id'},
    {name: 'table'},
    {name: 'field'},
    {name: 'title'}

    }),

            metaDataStore.each(function(r) {
                this_column['id'] = r.data['id'];
                this_column['header'] = r.data['title'];
                this_column['sortable'] = true;
                this_column['dataIndex'] = r.data['table'] + '.' + r.data['field'];
                // This display valid information, through the entire process
                console.info(this_column['id'] + ' : ' + this_column['header'] + ' : ' + this_column['sortable'] + ' : ' + this_column['dataIndex']);
                columns.push(this_column);
            });

            // This goes nuts at columns[15]

<p>After writing this I realized it becomes its own problem. The function is supposed to make information safe for HTML and SQL injection (there are other methods too, parameterized queries, etc but that's beside the point). However what happens, is that it first replaces <code>&amp;lt;</code> with <code>&amp; lt;</code>  and then proceeds to replace the newly written string again as every replace string has &amp;, # and ; signs in it.</p>

<p>Any hints? I thought about using a regex for this, but I couldn't find any decent Visual Basic examples that were simple enough.</p>

<p><b>Edit:</b> Thanks for the tips. I was sure there would be a ""smart"" easy way to do this, but I guess there are no common methods available after all. The re-arranging the problem cases first is the obvious solution here, thanks for that. I guess the work day was too long for me to notice. :D</p>

<p>As for parametirized queries, checking back I see my English doesn't come out as intended. I meant to say that I'm already using them, that this problem here is specific to prevent all manner of html-injection and possible sql-injection using the same strings elsewhere later.

<p>Now lets say you have a ""sub tab"" under this main one. So there were for example View and Add tabs displayed once you had selected the main Questions tab. Some questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Would it be best to have a set of routes like <a href=""http://site/questions/view"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://site/questions/view</a> and <a href=""http://site/questions/add"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://site/questions/add</a> for those two instances?</p></li>
<li><p>Would you therefore have a NavigationController that contained actions for each of the main tabs i.e. Questions, Tags, etc and then and id value for the sub tab i.e. View and Add. This would then give you something like the following:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>public ActionResult Questions(string view)</p>

<p>public ActionResult Tags(string view)</p>

<p>Etc</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Or would you have a controller per tab/navigation item and if so how would that be implemented?</p></li>
<li><p>Say you needed to show the tab(s) selected via something like highlighting. In the view (I guess you would have a partial view for this) for the navigation tabs, would this directly reference the URL to determine which should be highlighted or is this best acieved some other way?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I tried implementing the command pattern in Silverlight and hit a wall.
They say commands are great, because you can write them into xaml, so you can keep your code-behind clean, also you have loose coupling between your view and your viewmodel because there is no direct reference to the viewmodel in the view.</p>

<p><strong>You can not keep your code-behind clean</strong>, because you can bind only one command to a control, and you have to decide which event will fire your command when you bind it. If a control has 30 events, you have to choose one for commanding. The other 29 will execute the other commands from event handlers from the code behind.</p>

<p><strong>Loose coupling can be achieved more simply by dependency injection</strong>, commands add a useless layer of indirection that gives nothing extra, they only make it a bit harder to maintain your code. It is easier to maintain your code, when you are programming against an interface and see exactly what method gets called, then when you have to keep jumping between your command definitions and your viewmodel.</p>

<p>Did I miss anything, or commands are really not meant to be used for view and viewmodel interaction?</p>

<p>Please see the following question. This is why I don't get all the hype with commands:</p>

They already had it in their minds that they wanted Subversion, and since I had experience using and setting up subversion, I was a good candidate.  I first tried to sell TFS because it woul dhave solved the problem I am in right now, but since money is tight, and Subversion is free... well you get it.  Anyway, I have finalized the propsal and the only thing standing in the way is the following.</p>

<p>I proposed that we store only our source code in SVN, and all documentation, release builds, and other project artifracts be stored in our SharePoint portal, so we don't have to give non developer stakeholders access to SVN.  When I presented the proposal, all was excepted but the question arose about how to manage the syncronization between the artifacts (Ex: How to is document x version 3.1.2 associated with release 4.5.2).  My initial reaction is to create a section in the SharePoint porject page for each new release that will hold the artificats (and keep track of changes too).  Is there a better way of doing this?  Does anyone know of anyone doing this?  Or any integration packages to sync SVN with SharePoint?</p>

<p>Here is some info on the companies development environment.  All of our software is for internal use, we sell none of it, so our customers are all in-house.  We have 2 types of developers: 1. those who take care of maintainance and customization of third party software, and 2. those who write proprieatry software (which is where I fall).  Our software we write is mostly .NET, but the 3rd party software is all over the board (COBAL, C, FORTRAN, Other crap that no ones cares about anymore).  </p>

The modifications are performed through an ajax call that basically updates properties of that object.  When the user is done working, I have a basic 'Save Changes' button that allows them to Save the data and flush the cached object.</p>

<p>In order to protect the user, I want to warn them if the try to navigate away from the page when modifications have been made to the server object if they have not saved.  So, I created a web service method called IsInitialized that will return true or false based on whether or not changes have been saved.  If they have not been saved, I want to prompt the user and give them a chance to cancel their navigation request.</p>

<p>Here's my problem - although I have the calls working correctly, I can't seem to get the ajax success call to set the variable value on its callback function.  Here's the code I have now.</p>

<pre><code>   ////Catches the users to keep them from navigation off the page w/o saved changes...
window.onbeforeunload = CheckSaveStatus;
var IsInitialized;

function CheckSaveStatus() {

<p>In one of my prototype methods I'm calling the <strong>$.ajax</strong> method in <strong>jQuery</strong>. What I then want to do is pass the returned JSON data into a method inside my JavaScript webchat namespace.</p>

<p>The problem seems to be because I've created an instance of my JavaScript webchat, I can't directly call a method inside it because I need to address it through the instance.</p>

    // Set-up AJAX defaults
    $.ajaxSetup({ type: ""POST"", contentType: ""application/json; charset=utf-8"", dataType: ""json"" });
}

AvonAndSomerset.WebchatV3.prototype =
{
    // Get latest Member,Quetsion,Transcript and Room data from server
    GetUpdate: function(StartUp) {

        $.ajax({ url: ""JSON.aspx/Members_GetChanges"",

I plan on writing a web application that will leverage these APIs to provide basic information on the status of the application. I plan to use AJAX (using jQuery) to show the information.</p>

<p>Originally I planned on using Grails, Spring MVC, RoR or one of the web frameworks to handle the back end of my application. The REST APIs I will be providing though are already built on a stanalone REST framework so I would only be leveraging the web framework for the core application and not the business logic. In the future, I might need the server side framework to handle other tasks but for now most of the work is done in the REST APIs.</p>

<p>My question is, should I bother with using a web application framework on the server side? I should be able to make all the API calls I need from AJAX directly from the browser. I cannot think of much I would need to do on the server side. Would it make sense to have the application be standard HTML + AJAX + REST?</p>

<p>in  response to a question below: the information required to determine which controls to restore is contained in a dedicated viewstate object.</p>

<p>I am dynamically creating controls in the codebehind page - these controls are all hooked up to click handlers so when a postback occurs I must re-create the previous set of controls, then clear the controls down and generate the new set of controls based on the previous click.</p>

<p>This is coded and working correctly under normal circumstances esentially as follows:</p>

<pre><code>in Page_Load
if not postback generate default buttons 
else if postback re-generate buttons that were shown on last page

in click_handler
Clear the dynamically generated buttons created in the Page_Load
generate new buttons based on the specific click being handled
</code></pre>

<p>however when the server comes under load we start getting problems:</p>

<p>With 5 users per second we start getting the exception:
<strong>Multiple controls with the same ID 'add0' were found. FindControl requires that controls have unique IDs.</strong></p>

<p>With 100 users per second we start getting the exception:
<strong>The control collection cannot be modified during DataBind, Init, Load, PreRender or Unload phases.</strong></p>

<p>Once this occurs all subsequent requests get the same error and IIS has to be re-started.</p>

<p>What could be causeing this and how can I avoid it?  Do html requests possibly overwrite and interfere with each other when under load? do objects somehow hand around after a page unload in a manner that would allow the next page load to trip over them?</p>

I'm curious because I've been toying with the idea of a distributed computing system where you can simply write programs, and the program itself would be distributed to each disparate node where work would occur.  I know you could do it by copying the actual assembly over the network and loading that in an appdomain, but I think it would be really interesting to have a simpler model to work with.</p>

This is somewhat equivalent to having one endpoint with a node between it and each endpoint, though the edges there have different weights.  The algorithm it uses is a simple spreading algorithm, which in 1d looks this this (| means wall, - means space):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>5 - - - 3 | - - - 2 - - - - 2</code></li>
<li><code>5 4 - - 3 | - - - 2 - - - - 2 : Handled distance 5 nodes</code></li>
<li><code>5 4 3 - 3 | - - - 2 - - - - 2 : Handled distance 4 nodes</code></li>
<li><code>5 4 3 2 3 | - - - 2 - - - - 2 : Handled distance 3 nodes</code></li>
<li><code>5 4 3 2 3 | - - 1 2 1 - - 1 2 : Handled distance 2 nodes</code></li>
<li><code>Done.  Any remaining rooms are unreachable.</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So, let's suppose I have a precalculated pathfinding solution like this one, where only the 5 is a target:</p>

<p><code>- - - - | 5 4 3 2 1 -</code></p>

<p>If I change the wall to a room.  Recomputing is simple.  Just re-handle all distance nodes (but ignore the ones which already exist).  However, I am not able to figure out an efficient way to handle what to do if the 4 became a wall.  Clearly the result is this:</p>

<p><code>- - - - | 5 | - - - -</code></p>

<p>However, in a 2d solution I'm not sure how to efficiently deal with 4.  It is easily possible to store that 4 depends on 5 and thus needs recaculation, but how do I determine its new dependency and values safely? I'd rather avoid recalculating the entire array.</p>

<p>One solution, which is better than nothing, is (roughly) to only recalculate array elements with a manhattan distance of 5 from the 5, and to maintain source information. 
This would basically mean reapplying the algorithm to a selected area But can I do better?</p>
