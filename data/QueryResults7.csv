<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The kind of things giving me troubles in asp.net that makes me wonder for the switch:</p>

<p>Here is a sample of a page giving me problems.   </p>

<p>There is a tree table (master / details)  </p>

<p>You can edit fields on each child row.  </p>

<p>When you press the save button, the data from the group row must be updated (just data from a select, no modification in database), as
the data from the child row.</p>

<p>I don't want to refresh the whole page because the displayed records are based from search criterias.</p>

<p>The Master / Details are generated using Repeaters</p>

<p>Trying to update a record from code behind is really quirky, and still have no clue about updating the display.</p>

<p>Using jQuery and a web service, my guess would be that i could update directly to the database, request what I want to be displayed and just update that record. This is the kind of things that make me wonder if asp.net is just getting in my way.</p>

<p><strong>Edit2:</strong>
The problem I have about ASP.NET is not related to ajax. Yes, I use jQuery to make the interfaces more dynamic like showing / hiding the search section when not needed and collapsing details from the tree, but this is all I do with it.</p>

<p>What bothers me is that if I want to check which button has been clicked in this example, I have to use some tricks that feel a bit haky.</p>

<p>If you want to use databound comboboxes in a repeater, you have to use codebehind to set the selected value, it will be a pain to retreive the data selected.</p>

<p>Next, if you want to check what data was modified, you have to save the datatable in the viewstate, read data from all controls in the repeater, then compare with the datatable to make an update. This is this kind of things that bother me with asp.net.</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> Write the methods to class library -> compile/build it -> add the library as a reference to the program - which would need to sanitize some variables ?</p>

<p>Or would it be exactly the same if I where to: </p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> Create a new SanitizeClass in the program -> add all the sanitize methods -> call the methods from the SanitizeClass in the different classes in the program that needs to sanitize variables</p>

<p>Table 2 has a PK int and another int column. When combined the two are unique.</p>

<p>The paired value between the two ints is how we currently select the child records for either table.</p>

<p>I have a web application with user controls and resources that are shared by three other web applications.</p>

+-CommonControlsWebApp
| +- resources
| |  +- images
| |  +- scripts
| |  +- stylesheets
| +- UserControls
| 
+-WebApp1
| 
+-WebApp2
| 
+-WebApp3
</pre>

<p>This is what I know this far:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can not compile CommonControlsWebApp into a single dll since I am creating user controls. This is only possible with custom server controls, where everything is in the code-behind file. So I need a way to share the ascx files between the four projects.
<li>Copying the files from CommonControlsWebApp into the three other projects does not update their files in the solution explorer. I would have to 'add exting items' all in all three WebApps when a file is added or renamed in CommonControls.
<li>Changing to the Web Site model would remedy this, but I am worried about the compile time for WebApp1-3 if I do this.
<li>'Add as link' does not work for directories.
<li>I could use Subversion to share the files between the projects, but i believe that this would require me to check the files in and out again all the time if I am developing a user control that I have to test through one of the WebApps.
</ul>

<p><strong>Can it really be true that ASP.NET does not have a good solution for this? How are you guys organizing large web applications?</strong></p>

<p>Edit: Thanks a lot for all the answers. I am going to copy my user controls with a build event for now, and then see if we have time to refactor them into server controls.</p>

<p>I can't use a fixed SQL statement, because depending on whether they search by date or by something else, the SQL would be different, so instead I have been generating a results list using a table web control that starts out invisible and then is filled and set to visible once the user identifies a search they want to make. I used a table control because its easy to create and modify in the code behind, and I was able to make the needed calls to the database and populate that table as required.</p>

<p>However, the second thing I need with this search page, is the ability to allow the user to select a record from the results and then go edit it using the rest of the CRUD based pages on the site. To do that, I created asp:buttons in the table and gave them all different ids and the same event handler. But since I created the buttons dynamically, it seems the event disappears on callback and my scheme fails, so I'm taking a second look at how to do this.</p>

<p>My current code for the events looks like:</p>

<pre><code> tempcell = new TableCell();
 Button tempbutton = new Button();
 tempbutton.Text = ""Go"";
 tempbutton.ID = ""gobutton"" + rowN;
 tempbutton.Visible = true;
 tempbutton.Click += new EventHandler(tempbutton_Click);
 tempcell.Controls.Add(tempbutton);
 temprow.Cells.Add(tempcell);
</code></pre>

<p>My results table is declared like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:Table ID=""ResultTable"" visible=""false"" runat=""server"" 
GridLines=""Both"" CellSpacing=""8""&gt;
&lt;/asp:Table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to be able to identify which record the user selected, so I can send that info on to another page. And of course, I still need to be able to generate results for several different search criteria. Currently I have date, template and code based searches that lead to different stored procedures and different parameters based on what the user has entered.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on this? It seems like the data grids and repeaters require SQL statements in advance to work properly, so I'm not sure how to use them, but if I could then the item command approach would work with the buttons.</p>

<p>So, I have a subclassed CALayer, say CustomLayer, and I figured I could register an observer  for the property in init:</p>

<pre><code>[self addObserver:self forKeyPath:@""superlayer"" options:0 context:nil]

<p>and implement <code>observeValueForKeyPath:ofObject:change:context</code>.  Nothing ever happens because, presumably, superlayer is a derived property (the attr dictionary stores an opaque ID for the parent).  Similarly, I can't subclass <code>setSuperlayer:</code> because it is never called.  In fact, as far as I can tell there are no instance methods called or public properties set on the sublayer when a parent does <code>[self addSublayer:aCustomLayer]</code>.  </p>

<p>Then I thought, OK, I'll subclass addSublayer like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)addSublayer:(CALayer *)aLayer {

    [super addSublayer:aLayer];
    [aLayer didChangeValueForKey:@""superlayer""];

<p>ASP.Net generates a javascript variable called Page_Validators, which is an array of the validation spans.  This script checks to see if it exists and then loops through and sets the class name.  I added this to the master page and its working so far.</p>

<p>Floating the list next to the image also works, but I don't know when the list is next to a float. I don't want to float every list in my content just to fix this. Also, floating left messes up the layout when an image is floated <em>to the right</em> instead of left of the list.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The sidebar and the header are <em>static</em> and so is the body, however you can scroll the body.  Using the CSS property overflow:scroll on a container for the body section is not an option.  The reason being is that it's an ASP.NET application which utilises the maintainpositiononscrollback, meaning that the <em>browser</em> scrollbar - not a contain scrollbar - is what is used to record the x and y position.  I have achieved this but using some complex layout techniques which just aren't pretty.</p>

<p>So my HTML looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""header""&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/""&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;Telephone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;My Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;My Profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=""sidebar-container""&gt;
  &lt;div id=""sidebar""&gt;
    &lt;!-- sidebar code using ul's and li's --&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=""content-top-border""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""content-left-border""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=""content-wrap""&gt;
  &lt;div id=""content""&gt;
    &lt;asp:ContentPlaceHolder ID=""MainContent"" runat=""server"" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=""content-right-border""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""content-bottom-border""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""bottom-block""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I use all of these divs for a specific reason, so I can absolutely position borders on the content area.  The rest of the divs actually block off content by changing the background colour of them so you can't see the content when you scroll.</p>

<p>My CSS file is far too large to be posting on here, but here's the general idea:</p>

<pre><code>div#header {
    height:30px;
    background-color:#d7d7d7;
    position:fixed;
    top:0;
    left:0;
    right:0;
}

div#sidebar {
    position:fixed;
    top:30px;
    left:0;
    overflow:auto;
    bottom:4px;
    width:148px;
    background-color:#d7d7d7;
}

div#sidebar ul {
    border:1px solid #9a9a9a;
    border-bottom:0;
    font-family:Tahoma;
    margin:0 0 0 4px;
    padding:0;
    list-style-type:none;
    font-size:0.75em;
    width:137px;
    clear:both;
    background-color:white;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So as you can see from the sidebar, I set a fixed width, make it <code>position:fixed</code> and then set a background.  The containing <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> has a fixed width thus causing a block.  When you horizontally scroll the page, the content will be hidden when it hits the sidebar.  This creates an effect much like any client-side application.</p>

<pre><code>#content-wrap {
    position: absolute;
    top: 30px;
    bottom: 15px;
    left: 147px;
    right:0;
    background-color:#d7d7d7;
    z-index:-998;
}

#content {
    z-index:-995;
    position:absolute;
    top:0;
    bottom:0;
    right:0;
    left:0;
    padding:10px 10px 20px 10px;
    background-color:#FFF;
    color:#292929;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So you can see that the #content has absolute positioning keeping it in that content box.  Anything outside of the content box is <em>never</em> displayed even if you scroll horizontally or vertically.</p>

<p>Are there better ways of doing this?  It seems a heck-of-a-lot of HTML/CSS to be doing something really quite simple.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: This layout isn't a problem whatsoever.  That part isn't even difficult.  What's difficult is maintaining simple HTML/CSS with a complex layout, and by complex, I don't mean something I'm unable to achieve.

We got onto the topic of C# and .NET generally, and he made the point to me that he felt it was 'doomed' for all of the commonly-cited issues (low speed, breakable bytecode, etc). I agreed with him on all those issues, but I held back in saying it was doomed, only because I felt that, in time, languages like C# could instead become native code (if Microsoft so chose to change the implementation of .NET from a bytecode, JIT runtime environemnent to one which compiles directly to native code like your C++ program does).</p>

<p>My question is, am I out to lunch here? I mean, it may take a lot of work (and may break too many things), but there isn't some type of magical barrier which prevents C# code from being compiled natively (if one wanted to do it), right? There was a time where C++ was considered a very high-level language (which it still is, but not as much as in the past) yet now it's the bedrock (along with C) for Microsoft's native APIs. The idea that .NET could one day be on the same level as C++ in that respect seems only to be a matter of time and effort to me, not some fundamental flaw in the design of the language.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I should add that if native compilation of .NET is possible, why does Microsoft choose not to go that route? Why have they chosen the JIT bytecode path?</p>

<li>Entity Class that needs manual coding</li>

<p>While NHibernate is a wonderful framework, but the need to write mapping file and to create entity classes that mimic the database tables are pain in neck to write. There are a few tools that can alleviate this problem, such as Castle ActiveRecord or NHibernate Fluent.</p>

<p>But as much as those tools can reduce code repeatation problem, there are still some duplication code that you have to write, or some decorative attributes that you have to put on.

When I specify the filter using a constant parameter, everything is great and performance is almost instantaneous.  When I specify the filter using a variable parameter, it takes a significantly larger chunk of time, on the order of 500x more logical reads and 20x greater duration.</p>

<p>The execution plan shows that in the variable parameter case the filter is not applied until very late in the process, causing multiple index scans rather than the seeks that are performed in the constant case.</p>

<p>I guess my questions are:  Why, since I'm specifying a single filter parameter that is going to be highly selective against an indexed field, does my performance go into the weeds when that parameter is in a variable?  Is there anything I can do about this?</p>

<li>""Document"" - Name of the document which is a link that opens the document in MS Word.</li>
<li>""Done?"" - Yes/No tickbox.</li>
</ol>

<p>The user gets an e-mail when they have a task assigned; the e-mail contains an URL to the custom DispForm.aspx, the user clicks the link and voila, they see the customized DispForm.aspx with only 2 fields, they know exactly what to do because they won't get distracted by an information-overdose and the only thing the user has to do is click on the document so it would open in Word, user makes changes to document, saves, ticks ""yes"" in the ""Done?"" tickbox and the next workflow starts. </p>

<p>Now I'm having this particular problem, when I customize the document library's DispForm.aspx in Sharepoint Designer and add a custom Sharepoint control (Custom Document Library listform) it does not contain the Name field (which contains the URL). I can manually add that link in Sharepoint Designer but then the document gets opened in the web version of Word and if the user wants to save it, it saves to the local harddrive, instead of the Document Library.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? How can I include the right URL to a document in a customized DispForm of a document library which opens the document in Word and saves to the Document library and creates a draft version?</p>

<p>Suggestions, tips or other solutions VERY welcome!</p>

<p><strong>SystemCodes</strong>
SysCodeID

Description</p>

<p>The question I have is for when the user is entering data into the <strong>results</strong> table.</p>

<p>The formatting code when the row gets the focus changes the value field to a dropdown combobox if the testCode is of type SystemList.  The drop down has a list of all the system codes that have a parentsyscodeID of the test.SysCodeID.  When the user chooses a value in the list it translates into a number which goes into the value field.</p>

<p>The datatype of the Results.Value field is integer.  I made it an integer instead of a string because when reporting it is easier to do calculations and sorting if it is a number.  There are issues if you are putting integer/decimal value into a string field.  As well, when the system was being designed they only wanted numbers in there.</p>

<p>The users now want to put strings into the value field as well as numbers/values from a list and I'm wondering what the best way of doing that would be.</p>

<hr>

<p>Would it be bad practice to convert the field over to a string and then store both strings and integers in the same field?  There are different issues related to this one but i'm not sure if any are a really big deal.</p>

<p>Should I add another column into the table of string datatype and  if the test is a string type then put the data the user enters into the different field.</p>

<p>Another option would be to create a 1-1 relationship to another table and if the user types in a string into the value field it adds it into the new table with a key of a number.</p>

<p>Anyone have any interesting ideas?</p>

The challenge will be recognizing things like method signatures across multiple lines.  You could join the string array returned by gc and search on that to make it easier.  If no one answers, I'll eventually post a solution, but probably many weeks from now.</p>

<p>Update:  I'm looking for a Powershell solution because that's already my main scripting language, and I'd like to be able to make changes over time, perhaps extend it to cover JavaScript for example, or change the report format, and I'd like it to work with any version of Visual Studio and C#.

<p><strong>1.</strong> the (self != nil) check in initializer code. Why do it? To prevent accidental access to some ""run-only-once"" code that's wrapped up in there? Where from could this accidental access come from? Doing such checks suggest that I don't have control over what's going on.</p>

<p><code><pre>
- (id)init {
    self = [super init]
    if (self != nil) {
    // Code..
    }
    return self;
}
</pre></code></p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> How is it that you don't have to free up anything that static methods return? (or this is the idea I've got)</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> How is str = @""Hi there!"" different from</p>

<p><code><pre>str = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@""Hi there!""];</pre></code></p>

<p>As I understand, you have to release str in aquired with second method, but not with first? If so, when does the first one get released? Which one is preferable (not minding the typing length)?</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> What is autorelease, if iphone has no garbage collection? I've noticed something called ""an autorelease pool"" being created in main.m. Is [myObject autorelease]; a way of adding myObject to the nearest wrapping ""autorelease pool"", which will release it? Basically, some magic to avoid releasing it yourself? Why use it?</p>

<p>It's started out easily enough with me creating a table with percentage based column widths (and the overall table being 100% width).</p>

<p>For now, I've got a small piece of JQuery letting me change the scale of my text but its only to prove the concept.</p>

<p>I'm really after being able to automatically scale the font and table cell sizes according to the available screen width and height. I do know the maximum string length allowed for each column cell so I could, potentally, automatically set the em/px size based on some calculation.</p>

<p>However, I'm a bit stuck as where to start. I'm actively developing this now but my initial thoughts are:</p>

<p>scale = maxstringwidth_inpx / currentcellwidth_inpx</p>

<p>Where I'd calculate maxstringwidth by having a lookup table and the font metrics for a character 1em in size on the screen.</p>

<p>The cells are all assigned screen percentages so I should be able to read those directly.</p>

<p>Then I can set the font size, ie:</p>

<pre><code>$(""body"").css(""font-size"", currentfontsize_px * scale);
</code></pre>

<p>Does this sound a feasible approach? It also raises questions about the padding above and below each string in each cell but I'm sure I can do someting similar there too.</p>

<p>To qualify where I'm stuck:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are there examples of this kind of
thing out in the wild (I couldn't
find any) </li>
<li>Does my approach have
pitfalls? </li>
<li>Have you done it before
and can share wisdom/techniques?</li>
<li>Have I shot myself in the foot
already and should consider a
different approach?</li>
</ol>

<p>I have mentioned using Flash to the PM as a means of autoscaling the text as we can then do a lot of the font metrics in ActionScript. However, I'm only just starting out with that using the .NET flash IDE so I'd be limited to that as a development platform.</p>

<p>Thanks for any tips, examples and advice!</p>

<p>Everything works great, but in order to follow the operating system specs on how to handle the finished buffers, I added a thread that unprepares the buffers and frees the memory.  I also got all of the synchronization down, so that the classes are solid and thread-safe.</p>

Each type of web page provides the same kind of data. The problem is that the HTML of each page is different, so the location of the data varies. Another problem is that the HTML code is poorly formatted, making it impossible to use a XML-like parser. </p>

<p>So far, the best strategy I can think of, is to define a template for each kind of page, like:</p>

<p>Template A:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
...
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Table column that is missing a td

...

<p>This way I would only need one single parser for all the pages, that would compare each page with its template and retrieving the <code>$data_item_1$</code>, <code>$data_item_2$</code>, etc.  Still, it is going to be a lot of work.  Can you think of any simpler solution? Any library that can help?</p>

<p>Suppose you write a function in your SQL database, whose inputs and outputs are contained within the scope of a database transaction.</p>

<p>That is, if you call this function in the scope of a database transaction, all the data used by the function is available within the same scope.  It can query a database table, but it can't read a file from the filesystem, or ping a web site, etc.  If you call the function twice within a single transaction with <code>REPEATABLE READ</code> isolation, you should get the same result, even if other clients are making changes in the database.</p>

<p>Likewise, the function has no side-effects, except within the same transaction scope.  Changes in state outside the scope of the database transaction are not allowed.  The function shouldn't send emails, nor write to the filesystem, nor store a value in <code>memcached</code>, etc.  If the function changes data within the database, that's okay because if the calling transaction is rolled back, then the effects of the function are too.</p>

<p>The arguments of the function are okay, since they're basically used as constants.</p>

<p>What would be the proper term for a function of this type?  ""Deterministic"" doesn't really seem to be specific enough.  How would you describe this class of function?</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks for your answers, but none of them is exactly what I had in mind.  Idempotent gets closest, so I marked that as the accepted answer.  But each of you got an upvote from me regardless.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pure functions</strong> have no side-effects, and their result is based solely on their arguments.  The result given the same arguments is always identical.  This doesn't work because the database functions I have in mind can be based on the state of data, and the function can also affect the state of data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Idempotent functions</strong> can return a result based on the state of data, and given the same state of data, the result is always identical.  But this doesn't work for what I have in mind exactly; the effects of an idempotent functions must result in an unchanging result no matter how many times the function is called.  But there's no distinction between changes made within transaction isolation and changes made external to that scope.</p></li>

<pre><code>typedef struct dictNode {
    int key;
    char *value;
    struct dictNode *next;
} Dict;
</code></pre>

<p>And a <strong>get()</strong> function that goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>char *get(const Dict *dict, int key) {
    if(!dict) return NULL;

    Dict *currPtr = dict;

    while(currPtr) {

            return currPtr-&gt;value;
        }

        currPtr = currPtr-&gt;next;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Compiling this code produces the following error:<br>
<strong>dict.c:85: warning: initialization discards qualifiers from pointer target type</strong></p>

<p>This warning refers to the line:</p>

<pre><code>Dict *currPtr = dict;
</code></pre>

<p>If I add a ""const"" before that line like this:</p>

<pre><code>const Dict *currPtr = dict;
</code></pre>

<p>The warning goes away...</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> First thing I don't understand is this: I added ""const"" to the <strong>dict argument</strong> in <strong>get()</strong> so that the compiler warns me if I try to change the address dict is pointing to, otherwise I won't be able to access the dictionary in the main program cause I lost the address I was pointing too. Now, I'm creating a new pointer, <strong>currPtr</strong>, that points to the same place as <strong>dict</strong>. This way, I use this pointer instead, to traverse the dictionary and keep <strong>dict</strong> pointer intact. Why do I also need to have <strong>const</strong> for <strong>currPtr</strong>?</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> Second thing I don't understand is this: The line <strong>currPtr = currPtr->next;</strong> is changing the <strong>currPtr</strong> pointer, so, why doesn't the compile warn me about that if I added a <strong>const</strong> to <strong>currPtr</strong>?</p>

<p>Then I have a <strong>del()</strong> function that goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>Dict *del(const Dict *dict, int key) {
    if(!dict) return NULL;

    Dict *currPtr = dict;
    Dict *prevPtr = dict;

    while(currPtr) {
        if(currPtr-&gt;key == key) {
            prevPtr-&gt;next = currPtr-&gt;next;
            free(currPtr);
        }

        prevPtr = currPtr;
        currPtr = currPtr-&gt;next;
    }

    return dict;
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Please note that I'm aware that this delete function code is not complete, it does not correctly work if I want to delete the first element for instance. It doesn't matter, I'll finish later, it suffices to demonstrate my problem...</em></p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> So, in the <strong>get()</strong> function I needed to add <strong>const</strong> to <strong>currPtr</strong> but in this <strong>del()</strong> function, I don't need to add <strong>const</strong> to <strong>currPtr</strong> nor <strong>prevPtr</strong>? In both functions I am changing the <strong>currPtr</strong> pointer and in the case of the <strong>del()</strong> function I'm changing the <strong>prevPtr</strong> pointer too. Why does the <strong>get()</strong> function require me to add a <strong>const</strong> before <strong>currPtr</strong> and the <strong>del()</strong> function does not require me to add a <strong>const</strong> before <strong>currPtr</strong> and <strong>prevPtr</strong>?</p>

<p>I can basically resume this whole post to: When and where exactly in my <strong>get()</strong> and <strong>del()</strong> functions should I use <strong>const</strong> and why, and, when and where I shouldn't?</p>

When I do this, the XML emitted now has type information applied to all elements.  I don't want this superfluous information, and I'm wondering how to inform the serializer to not output it.</p>

<p>Here's the sample code that uses [DataContract]:</p>

<pre><code>[DataContract(Namespace = """")]
class Test 
{
    public Test() { }
    [DataMember]
    public Nullable&lt;int&gt; NullableNumber = 7;
    [DataMember]
    public int Number = 5;

    public static void Go()
    {
        var test = new Test();
        var dcs = new DataContractSerializer(typeof(Test));
        using (var s = new StreamWriter(""test.xml""))
        {
            dcs.WriteObject(s.BaseStream, test);
        }
    }        
}
</code></pre>

<p>This outputs the following XML (notice no type info on Nullable Number and Number--this is the desired output):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Test xmlns:i=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""&gt;
  &lt;NullableNumber&gt;7&lt;/NullableNumber&gt;
  &lt;Number&gt;5&lt;/Number&gt;
&lt;/Test&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If I modify the above code as follows (adding [Serializable], : ISerializable, and the two serialization methods):</p>

<pre><code>[Serializable]
class Test : ISerializable
{
    public Test() { }
    public Nullable&lt;int&gt; NullableNumber = 7;
    public int Number = 5;

    public static void Go()
    {
        var test = new Test();
        var dcs = new DataContractSerializer(typeof(Test));
        using (var s = new StreamWriter(""test.xml""))
        {
            dcs.WriteObject(s.BaseStream, test);
        }
    }        
    public Test(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)
    {
        NullableNumber = info.GetInt32(""NullableNumber"");
        Number = info.GetInt32(""Number"");
    }

    public void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)
    {
        info.AddValue(""NullableNumber"", NullableNumber);
        info.AddValue(""Number"", Number);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It now emits the following XML.  Notice the type information (i:type=""x:int"") added to each element.  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;Test xmlns=""http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/XMLSerialization"" xmlns:i=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:x=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""&gt;
  &lt;NullableNumber i:type=""x:int"" xmlns=""""&gt;7&lt;/NullableNumber&gt;
  &lt;Number i:type=""x:int"" xmlns=""""&gt;5&lt;/Number&gt;
&lt;/Test&gt;

<p>This problem does not happen on FF (probably 3).</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>The problem appears to be in using assigning the result of window.open() when doing ""var w"". When I split the line into two statements it works in IE8.</p>

Because of that, I am concerned about the integrity of the message being maintained between the time I send it, and the time that I receive it back.</p>

<p>It should be assumed that once I send the message to myself, no information about the message sent will be available to me in the future.  The message is completely self-contained.</p>

<p>To that end, I know that should hash the message contents and compare the hashes before I send the message, and after I send the message, if they differ, then the message has been tampered with.</p>

<p>Of course, if the man-in-the-middle knows that the hash is really just the hash of the message contents, as-is, then because the message is self-contained, he can just create new contents and apply the same hash algorithm to the contents.</p>

<p>The question is, to what lengths should I go to randomize the message contents when generating the hash?  When does it reach the point of diminishing returns?</p>

<p>In this scenario, I have a set of key/value pairs.  To that end, the steps that I know I HAVE to take are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a salt to the message.  The salt is a secret to the rest of the world.  It gets attached to the contents of the message before hashing.</li>
<li>Order the key/value pairs in a consistent manner before generating the hash.</li>
<li>While not <em>directly</em> relevant, a timestamp is going to be added to the contents of each message before hashing, to prevent replay attacks.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are the optional steps that I am considering:</p>

<ol>
<li>Transforming the keys before I order them.  I've considered reversing them, then ordering by count/key.</li>
<li>Playing with the separators that separate key/value pairs (both for the separator for the key/value and the separator for the pair).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>

<p>Message privacy is <strong>not</strong> a requirement here, so I am not looking for encryption.  The values <em>must</em> be transmitted in plain-text.</p>

<p>Finally, what hashing algorithms should I avoid?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Specifics</strong></p>

<p>I have an ASP.NET MVC site which I have a controller which handles input validation and persistence.</p>

<p>If (based on a heuristic, it's not important which) the input is determined to be an automated spam attempt, a model of <code>IDictionary&lt;string, string&gt;</code> is created with the input values and a ViewResult is sent to a general CAPTCHA page.</p>

<p>In that view, in the form that contains the CAPTCHA control, the contents of the <code>IDictionary&lt;string, string&gt;</code> will be written out in hidden input fields, and the action of the form will be the same action that the contents were originally posted to.  This way, MVC can pick up the values when the form is resubmitted.</p>

<p>It's because of this I can't encrypt the key/value pairs (or maybe I can and should, tell me why and how!).</p>

<p>Of course, I need to add one more value, which contains the hashed message contents.  If that value is there, then the controller will check to see that the message integrity is maintained, and allow the input to be persisted if it has.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>I've opted to go with the SignedCms class in the System.Security.Cyrptography.Pkcs namespace, which represents the signging and verifying of CMS/PKCS #7 messages.</p>

<p>To elaborate, I've created a self-issued certificate with MAKECERT.EXE and then in my code, I use the example here to digitally sign the data:</p>

<p><a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnfa/archive/2006/02/27/539990.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnfa/archive/2006/02/27/539990.aspx</a></p>

<p>Now, it should be a matter of keeping the password on the exported private key secure, as well as security on the server, which makes it less about programming.</p>

<p>I'll have to add an extra key for the timestamp for replay attacks, but that won't be too hard.</p>

<p>The answer goes to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/85763/kalium"">Kalium</a>, not for his <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/710805/maintaining-message-integrity/710816#710816"">initial post</a>, but for his follow up comments which pointed the way to digital signatures, and eventually my discovery of how to utilize them in .NET.</p>

<p>I am wondering if such an AI exists (or is being researched/developed) that it writes programs by generating and compiling code all on it's own and then progresses by learning from former iterations.  I am talking about working to make us, programmers, obsolete.  I'm imagining something that learns what works and what doesn't in a programming languages by trial and error.</p>

<p>I know this sounds pie-in-the-sky so I'm asking to find out what's been done, if anything.</p>

<p>Of course even a human programmer needs inputs and specifications, so such an experiment has to have carefully defined parameters.  Like if the AI was going to explore different timing functions, that aspect has to be clearly defined.</p>

<p>But with a sophisticated learning AI I'd be curious to see what it might generate.</p>

<p>I know there are a lot of human qualities computers can't replicate like our judgement, tastes and prejudices.  But my imagination likes the idea of a program that spits out a web site after a day of thinking and lets me see what it came up with, and even still I would often expect it to be garbage; but maybe once a day I maybe give it feedback and help it learn.</p>

<p>Another avenue of this thought is it would be nice to give a high-level description like ""menued website"" or ""image tools"" and it generates code with enough depth that would be useful as a code completion module for me to then code in the details.  But I suppose that could be envisioned as a non-intelligent static hierarchical code completion scheme.</p>

<p>How about it?</p>

I'd like to do some resizing of the window based on the number of rows in a datatable that's coming back. So naturally I go to register a startup script that resizes the window based on the number of rows. Well, that didn't work, so I tried to register a script that just showed a msgbox. </p>

<p>The code looks like (in the OnLoad event handler): </p>

<pre><code> if (!this.ClientScript.IsStartupScriptRegistered(typeof(MyPageClassName), ""hello""))
        {
            this.ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript(typeof(MyPageClassName), ""hello"",
                    @""&lt;script language=vbscript&gt;
                        sub fnWindowOnLoad()
                            MsgBox """"hello""""
                        end sub
                        &lt;script&gt;"", false);

        {
            throw new Exception(""Failed to load script"");
        }
</code></pre>

<p>To me it looks like this should work and show a message box that says ""hello"" when the page loads (I've got the window's onload event set to fnWindowOnLoad). But what happens is nothing, no exception, no alert. I've tried every Type I could think of in the typeof call. Nothing seems to work. The only thing I can think of is that since the dialog is a modal ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript won't run properly. But that doesn't make any sense to me. </p>

<p>I put the MsgBox ""hello"" call into my script block directly and the alert showed, so it's possible. But I need to modify some arguments in the code behind so I have to use RegisterStartupScript as far as I can tell. </p>

<p>The program takes an XML file and exports it to a document. If the user wants, it will compress the file as well. The compression works fine and returns a Base64 String which is encoded into UTF-8 and written to a file.</p>

<p>When its time to reload the document into the program I have to check whether its compressed or not, the code is simply:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] gzBuffer = System.Convert.FromBase64String(text);
return ""1F-8B-08"" == BitConverter.ToString(new List&lt;Byte&gt;(gzBuffer).GetRange(4, 3).ToArray());

<p>It checks the beginning of the string to see if it has GZips code in it.</p>

<p>Now the thing is, all my tests work. I take a string, compress it, decompress it, and compare it to the original. The problem is when I get the string returned from an ADO Recordset. The string is exactly what was written to the file (with the addition of a ""\0"" at the end, but I don't think that even does anything, even trimmed off it still throws). I even copy and pasted the entire string into a test method and compress/decompress that. Works fine.</p>

<p>The tests will pass but the code will fail using the exact same string? The only difference is instead of just declaring a regular string and passing it in I'm getting one returned from a recordset.</p>

I tried ""upgrading"" Windows (to the same version) since I didn't see a repair option for Vista and it's still a no-go. I reinstalled everything that seemed relevant.

<p>and it doesn't seem good to have a lot of connections to sqlite.  This seems to be bad for the web and most applications that have more than a few users.  I'm having a hard time thinking of what sqlite would be used for when you don't need that many connections.  Every program I can think of needs users, lots of them sometimes, so what would I use a database for that doesn't allow that many connections?  I thought about prototypes but why would I use that when I can just connect to a larger database?  Embedded apps maybe?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Thanks everyone.  I look at the page recommended below but an confused about something:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Under appropriate uses for sqlite it has:</a></p>

<p>Situations Where SQLite Works Well</p>

<p>•Websites</p>

<p>SQLite usually will work great as the database engine for low to medium traffic websites (which is to say, 99.9% of all websites). The amount of web traffic that SQLite can handle depends, of course, on how heavily the website uses its database. Generally speaking, any site that gets fewer than 100K hits/day should work fine with SQLite. The 100K hits/day figure is a conservative estimate, not a hard upper bound. SQLite has been demonstrated to work with 10 times that amount of traffic.</p>

<p>Situations Where Another RDBMS May Work Better</p>

<p>•Client/Server Applications</p>

<p>If you have many client programs accessing a common database over a network, you should consider using a client/server database engine instead of SQLite. SQLite will work over a network filesystem, but because of the latency associated with most network filesystems, performance will not be great. Also, the file locking logic of many network filesystems implementation contains bugs (on both Unix and Windows). If file locking does not work like it should, it might be possible for two or more client programs to modify the same part of the same database at the same time, resulting in database corruption. Because this problem results from bugs in the underlying filesystem implementation, there is nothing SQLite can do to prevent it.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb is that you should avoid using SQLite in situations where the same database will be accessed simultaneously from many computers over a network filesystem.</p>

<p>The Question:</p>

<p>I'm going to show my ignorance here but what is the difference between these two?</p>

<p>For many - but not all - instances of Internet Explorer (reproduced so far on IE7 and IE8 beta - but not for everyone!) if you move between two secure pages that both contain this keep-alive IFRAME, you get something like this sequence of events:</p>

<pre>
 0s: load page1.html - includes keepalive.html, schedules a refresh at 15s
 5s: click the page2 link
     load page2.html - includes keepalive.html, schedules a refresh at 20s
15s: refresh of frame on page1 happens; mixed content error box displayed
</pre>

<p>At this point the error ""This page contains both secure and non-secure content"" is displayed in the browser. </p>

<p><em>page1.html:</em></p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Page 1&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is Page 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""page2.html""&gt;Go to Page 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=""keepalive.html"" width=""500"" height=""200"" /&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Page 2 is the same but says Page 2, and links to Page 1, instead.</p>

<p><em>keepalive.html:</em></p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=""refresh"" content=""15"" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This is the keep alive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In all the browsers I have tested this in I have ensured that the internet zone has permission to do a meta refresh and is set to prompt when displaying mixed content.  I have read all the pages suggesting that you need to have a src="""" tag on your IFRAME or IE will consider it insecure - by design it has to have a src tag, which is that of the keep-alive page.</p>

<p>If you sit on Page 1 forever, the IFRAME refreshes fine.  The error only shows up the first time after you change to Page 2.</p>

<p>I am looking for a way to fix this with minimal change: a better method for keep-alive would be to use a <a href=""http://www.adamtibi.net/post/2008/02/11/session-keep-alive-web-control.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">control &amp; automatically-refreshing images</a>, which I will investigate for future versions.  A possible workaround I have in mind is having contents of the IFRAME be a regular XMLHttpRequest to the server, instead of a meta refresh.  A simpler bugfix would be even better.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> I have marked Grant Wagner's answer as correct because it lead me to the actual problem: the Lenovo Password Manager add-on, CpwmIEBrowserHelper, causes this error.  This neatly explains why some people see this problem and not others - most of the people I asked have ThinkPads.  Disabling the extension makes the refresh problem go away.</p>

<p>As we can't cause everyone who might use the application to fix this problem, we are going to go with a javascript timer and refreshing the window location, updating the keepalive.html page to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=""pragma"" content=""no-cache""&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This is the keep alive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

  setTimeout ('ReloadPage()', 15000 );

  function ReloadPage() {
     window.location = window.location;
  }

&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

I don't know if that is true or not, but I am exploring the matter, and stressing out over how bad this whole 'DataAdapter/TableAdapter against a Typed DataSets' smells.</p>

<p>Let me try to explain...</p>

<p>Suppose I have my Typed DataSet defind in the xsd file, and now I'm ready to create a DataAdapter in code, against that schema...(By the way, I am using OleDb to access free-standing .dbf files in a folder... No SQL server stored procedures to call here, just plain old raw tables, ready for action.)</p>

<p>From my studies so far, here is how I see the DataAdapter used in conjunction with a Typed DataSet. Tell me if I am wrong. (Then I have my big complaint / question at the end.)</p>

<pre><code>public DataTable GetJobsByCustomer(string CustNo)
{
    OleDbConnection conn1 = new OleDbConnection(dbConnectionString);
    conn1.Open();

    LMVFP ds1 = new LMVFP(); //My Typed DataSet

    string sqlstring = @""SELECT act_compda, contact, cust_num, est_cost, invoiced, job_hours,
                        job_invnum, job_num, job_remark, job_start, mach_cost, mat_cost, mat_mkup,
                        p_o_num, priority, quote_no, quoted_by, ship_date, ship_info, shop_notes, status, total_cost
                        FROM job_info
                        WHERE (cust_num = ?) AND (status = 'A')
                        ORDER BY priority"";

    OleDbDataAdapter JobsAdapter = new OleDbDataAdapter(sqlstring,conn1);
    JobsAdapter.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add(""?"", OleDbType.VarChar,6).Value=CustNo;

    JobsAdapter.Fill(ds1, ""Jobs""); // A table schema in the Typed DataSet

    return ds1.Jobs;

}
</code></pre>

<p>Is that how it goes? It does work, so that's good. And indeed the strongly typed behavior is great.</p>

<p>Now, my gripe.... You mean to tell me that I've got maintain the same exaxt SQL syntax in my DAL method (GetJobsByCustomer) to match the schema of the table in the xsd?  It's crazy to have so much maintenance and dis-join between my hand-coded SQL and the xsd schema. There's no error cathing at all, since you are writing a text string!! You get to find out at run time if it will work.</p>

<p>When your typing all the SQL in code, it's terrible to have to look back and forth to keep your coded SQL in synch with the xsd table schema.</p>

<p>Surely I am missing something.</p>

<p>What a farce. The typed dataset works with beatiful intellisense and all, because it's generated from the schema, but when it comes down to it, it's just a pain to may to write SQL that matches the Typed schema. All they've done is move the headache to a new area.</p>

<p>Please tell me I am missing sometehing here that will make this much better.</p>

<p><strong>My Situation:</strong>
There are 1 server state, that can be online / offline, that has a client count, etc.
This could be my ""ServerModel"". I will handle the network connection through my network library and create student object if one is connected. That all happens here.
The view will be noticed if there is a new student and display a GUI element for the new student (through the controller). Now there is a action related to a special student in my view and the controller get notices ""StudentChanged"" and get the student that has changed. </p>

<p><strong>The Question:</strong>
The controller can now change the student directly OR tell the ServerModel how to change the student.
The 2nd method seems to be overdone on the first look, but keeps the MVC design clear.
I would like to change the student directly from the controller. But I'm not sure if this violation of the MVC (student is not a model but part of a model) brings any drawbacks in later development or the flexibility of the whole code.</p>

(That is, a C# program uses PInvoke to call my custom shared library which in turn calls another shared library.)</p>

<p>In Windows, my custom shared library links to the shared library when my custom library links and when the C# application executes, all symbols are resolved.</p>

<p>On Linux, linking my shared library does not link the other shared library. With a C++ driver, I specify the other library when the <em>application</em> is linked and at that time, all symbols are resolved. However, when I try to call my shared library from a C# program (compiled using mono) symbols in the other shared library are not resolved. I've tried using the MONO_PATH variable to specify the other library but it seems not to make a difference. I've also tried specifying the unresolved function in a DLLimport statement, but that seems not to help either.</p>

<p>How can I specify a shared library that is not directly called by C# code so that mono/cli finds it at run time?</p>

<p>I use the following commands to build the shared library:</p>

<pre><code>g++ -fPIC -g -c -Wall  libexif-wrapper.cpp
g++ -shared -Wl,-soname,libexif-wrapper.so.1     -o libexif-wrapper.so.1.0.1 libexif-wrapper.o -lc

<p>And the following command line to compile my C# driver:</p>

<pre><code>mcs -unsafe -define:LINUX Test-libexif-wrapper.cs

<p>On execution I get an error that a symbol used by my shared library is not found:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>(libexif-wrapper is my shared library which serves as a shim between the C# application and libexif.)</p>

<p>I have not been able to figure out how to solve this. Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<p>edit: To answer the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are you sure that the unmanaged
  libexif-wrapper can be found in the
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact it is not. I have crafted the path in the DLLImport to point directly to it instead. The run time finds it because it reports the path to it in the error message above. Further the missing symbol is not called by the C# program but rather one of the functions in my shared library calls the function that is then not found. (thanks - hank)</p>

update MyTable set Ordinal = Ordinal - 1 where Ordinal &lt;= @newOrdinal and ordinal &gt; @oldOrdinal

update MyTable set Ordinal = Ordinal + 1 where Ordinal &gt;= @newOrdinal and Ordinal &lt; @oldOrdinal

update MyTable set Ordinal = Ordinal - 1 where Ordinal &gt; @oldOrdinal
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think </p>

<pre><code>adapter.UpdateEntitiesDirectly(newValues, filter);
</code></pre>

<p>will work because newValues is going to be static when I need to add or subtract from the current value of the field</p>

<p>I also know I can achieve this using sprocs or triggers, but I'd like to do it through llblgen if possible.</p>

When I run the game in HighDefinition mode on the XBox360, I get an OOM exception.  If I don't enable MultiSampling, the game runs fine, but models are not anti-aliased and look terrible.</p>

<p>The following chunk of code seems to be the culprit.</p>

<p>I've found that for each window, I want to be able to store some values that aren't used directly.

So my real question here is, would it be legal to create custom CSS attributes (knowing full well that the browser would ignore them) with the sole purpose of keeping information like this on a per-div basis? Or would this be illegal, and should I look at another alternative?</p>

So my question is, can the two be merged together in 1 project, and if so, how?</p>

<p>I want to include a class within a class - sort of like variablizing a class - so that I can define something once and use it throughout the sheet.  If I change the color, it changes everything.</p>

<pre><code>.myFontColor{color:blue;}
.myTitle{font-size:large; myFontColor}
.myHeader{font-weight:bold; myFontColor}
</code></pre>

<p>The only way I see to do this is. To include every class name in the definition, but if I have 20 or 30 items in the sheet referring to that color, it's going to get ugly really fast.</p>

<pre><code>.myFontColor, .myTitle, .myHeader{color:blue;}
.myTitle{font-size:large;}
.myHeader{font-weight:bold;}
</code></pre>

<p>or to list a each class when I create an element, which gets a little messy too.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""myFontColor myTitle myHeader""&gt;

(So there are some design decisions that I can't touch unless I have a <i>seriously</i> compelling reason.)  The app controls a PC broadcasting audio and visual to a small local TV network.  Right now, it mostly broadcasts static slides, but it can also do background music at the client's discretion.  The background music (CD, local music files, internet radio, whatever) is handled by Windows Media Player.</p>

<p>My current project is adding narration to the static slides.  When the narration plays, I need to send some kind of STFU signal that temporarily either quiets or mutes the WMP output.  So my core question is:  What's the best way to accomplish this?</p>

<p>I know WMP has an ActiveX interface, but I'm not experienced with ActiveX/COM.  I can (and probably will) learn, certainly, but at this point, I'm not well positioned to distinguish between solutions that are easy, solutions that are technically feasible but painful, and ""solutions"" that are actually blind alleys.</p>

<p>Would a Java-based solution require me to make use of a Java->ActiveX bridge like Jacob?  Or is that overkill?</p>

<p>Or, am I barking up the wrong tree entirely?  I'm certainly willing to deploy small command-line executables written in another language entirely and then access them via Runtime.exec().  Is this the sort of thing that (say) VisualBasic makes dirt simple?  (VB isn't in my skillset either, but if it's the right tool for this job, I'll learn.  I just don't know if it's the right tool.  Google gave me plenty of examples of incorporating WMP into a VB GUI; VB command line script, not so much.)</p>

<p>Finally, one last point:  the WMP instance would be started by the user, not started by the Java app.  Don't know if that makes a difference, but figured it was worth mentioning.</p>

<p>My thanks in advance for any insight anybody can offer me.</p>

<p>I want to do a similar thing now in another application. Unfortunately it has been changed to use some classes from the MFC ""feature pack"", which are very pretty but this approach no longer works (it asserts, which I can fix with some minor modification but then the sidebar doesn't appear). The documentation for these new classes is woeful, so I'm having quite a bit of trouble figuring out what I'm supposed to do. I've tried what seems to be the ""new"" approach:</p>

Processes on each slave machine have to have a GUI and network access (I think it would be called an interactive process then). For ease of use it would be nice if the master machine could start/stop the processes on those slave machines.</p>

<p>My first idea was to use WMI and the Win32_Process class to start a remote process but upon further investigation it was reveiled that processes started this way are non-interactive and isolated, and thus cannot have any GUI. A note says that one can use Win32_ScheduledJob.Create to create a remote interactive process, but it runs under the LocalSystem account which I would like to avoid (also I couldn't even get it to run properly).</p>

<p>What would be good ways to solve this problem?
Maybe it is possible to launch a helper application which in turn starts a proper process, but that seems quite dirty.</p>

<p>Edit: PsExec was really clunky when I tried it and slow as hell (not sure why). Looking further at PsExec it seems it installs a temporary service on the remote machine to launch the application. Would this be the only way to spawn an interactive process using a proper identity? Should I include a helper service in the setup for the nodes?

The query should return the isavailable flag if it is not a holiday, or else return no records if it is a holiday.  I don't care about the other applications.</p>

<p>Also, what if I added a table like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>HoursOfOperations</strong><br>
  applicationid (int)<br>
  mondayopen (datetime)<br>
  mondayclose (datetime)<br>
  tuesdayopen (datetime)<br>
  tuesdayclose (datetime)<br>
  //open and close for all seven days of the week  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could I join on all three of these tables to only return a record if it is within the hours for the given day and is not a holiday?  Do I have to do this in separate queries?</p>

So, I am reading a book and going through examples trying to teach myself how to write an iPhone application using Objective-C.  All has been good so far, however, once in a while I run into the generic '<code>objc_exception_throw</code>' message at runtime.  When this happens, the source of this exception is very difficult to find.  After some trial and error I found my answer.  One of the parameters was misspelled.  </p>

<p>I'm investigating the possibility of building the dialog in .NET as a separate project (using Windows forms, not WPF) and providing a second C++/CLI project which calls it and which can be called from ordinary C++ code.  This structure is so that the several applications that need to incorporate the dialog can just pick up the projects in their solutions.

Converting the apps to C++/CLI is not an option.)</p>

<p>If you let this page load completely and look at it in any browser and in Chrome, you'll see that in ""any"" browser it looks right, and in Chrome something is obviously off. If you scroll all the way to the bottom, it looks right, though.
Try scrolling up, and at one point you'll notice the background ""ends"" (about 30% - 40% from the bottom).</p>

<p>According to FireBug, the element that has the background is 78,472 px tall. It IS way too tall, and in pages that are reasonably long, this effect is not seen.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, this happens in Chrome but not in Safari.</p>

<p>I tried making the background image taller, to try and figure out whether I was getting limited by the height of the element, or the number of times the background got repeated. Changed the image from 30px to 90px tall, and the cutoff is exactly at the same place, so that's not it.</p>

<p>Any ideas what could be going on, or whether there's something I can do to fix it?

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>In my application I do several requests to the very same webpage</li>
<li>Webpage has dynamic and random content in it such as (datetime, and quote of the day etc. in theory can be anything)</li>
<li>Response of this application has got 2 cases, let's call them ""TRUE"" and ""FALSE"". For example sometimes response would return a ""True Text"" sometimes it would be ""False Text"".</li>
<li>My application knows 3 samples of ""TRUE"" case and 3 samples of ""FALSE"" case, but these are also include random content such as ""time"" as well.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Now when my application gets a new response how can I understand if this response is an example of ""TRUE"" or ""FALSE"" case?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What I've tried</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Process the first sample of TRUE case line by line and generate an integer array from the value of characters</li>
<li>Do the same thing for second TRUE sample</li>
<li>Do the same thing for third TRUE sample</li>
<li>Analyse the differences between these stored TRUE cases and create a new array with </li>
<li>Now, I know which lines are dynamic (such as datetime), now I create a new final TRUE case array which stores only static lines to a final TRUE case array.</li>
<li>Now when I got a new case, I create a similar array then compare it with previously stored final TRUE case and if does match (except filtered lines) it's a TRUE case if other lines are massively changed (<em>there is a tolerance value</em>) then it's FALSE.</li>
</ul>

<p>Limitations and weaknesses of this algorithm is pretty obvious. Although I've got some good results in some cases, but it doesn't work as expected all the time.</p>

<p>My current class works like this:</p>

<pre><code>Dim Analyser AS NEW ContentAnalyzer()
Analyser.AddTrueCase(True1Html)
Analyser.AddTrueCase(True2Html)
Analyser.AddTrueCase(True3Html)

'This will return True if the UnknownHtml is similar to TRUE case, otherwise False

Now each star has random position jiggles and there can be a few extra or missing points in each image. My question is, ""What is the best 2D point matching algorithm for such a dataset?"" I guess both for a simple linear (translation, rotation, scale) and non-linear (say, n-degree polynomials in the coordinates). In the lingo of the point matching field, I'm looking for the algorithms that would win in a shootout between 2D point matching programs with noise and spurious points. There may be a different ""winners"" depending if the labeling info is used (the magnitudes) and/or the transformation is restricted to being linear.</p>

<p>I am aware that there are many classes of 2D point matching algorithms and many algorithms in each class (literally probably hundreds in total) but I don't know which, if any, is the consider the ""best"" or the ""most standard"" by people in the field of computer vision. Sadly, many of the articles to papers I want to read don't have online versions and I can only read the abstract. Before I settle on a particular algorithm to implement it would be good to hear from a few experts to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<p>I have a working matching program that uses triangles but it fails somewhat frequently (~5% of the time) such that the solution transformation has obvious distortions but for no obvious reason. This program was not written by me and is from a paper written almost 20 years ago. I want to write a new implementation that performs most robustly. I am assuming (hoping) that there have been some advances in this area that make this plausible.</p>

Each of these value types serves a somewhat different purpose and so are not exactly equivalent (id and name persist in different places). So we wind-up with a variety of values being passed around the application (ids, names and objects). This situation seems like a problem to at least some degree since we've already been bitten by bugs which involved not being clear what type should be passed to a given function. I actually recall seeing similar problem code in a number of applications over the years, though I again never gave a specific name to it. </p>

<p>Ruby, as a typeless language, does not allow classical type-based polymorphic functions in the way that C++ does. As a work around, a colleague has often resorted code of this sort:</p>

<pre><code>  def initialize starting_value
    if starting_post.kindof? Foo
      @starting_id = get_id_from_foo starting_value
    elsif starting_post.kindof? Bar

    else

<li>Is there a formal name for this as an
anti-pattern? ""Messy Interface?"", ""Messy Polymorphism?"" or something else?</li>
<li>How bad to do people think this is? </li>
<li>Is there a systematic way to refactor
this? The challenge that we have with
ordinary refactoring that many tests we're created use this 
loose-typing and thus we would have to change both
the tests and the implementations
simultaneously and so wouldn't have the scaffold effect of ordinary test-based
refactoring. I am think that one could actually ""strengthen"" this loose polymorphism, 
and abstract-out the code into a function rather than immediate rip it out. But would 
this be a good idea?</li>

<p>In case you're interested, I'll briefly explain why...</p>

<p><i>The majority of the users of our product don't know, understand or even care about the database underlying their business application. Traditionally we have simply installed SQL Server 2005 Express silently as part of the installation, with a SQL user and password embedded in the application. For the majority of ""Ma and Pa"" companies we've sold to over the past 10 years, this has been enough.</p>

<p>As security concerns are becoming more prominent and our product is starting to reach some larger scale users (with IT consultants or even staff of their own that do have a clue about security) some with their own pre-existing (pre ""our product"" being installed) SQL servers we find we are needing to fit into existing environements more flexibly.</p>

<p>I don't have a problem with that, but I do not want to force decisions about SQL server authentication methods, user names and passwords etc, etc, onto our ""lowest common denominator"" user, at installation. </p>

<p>If that's all to hard, we lose them before we even get started.</p>

<p>So, I would like for our application to be able to determine quickly and easily what mode the server is running in, and build its connection string appropriately.</p>

<p>Currently we are simply using trial and error - try to connect with Windows Authentication, connect? = good, fail? = try with SQL and the known user name/password, connect? = good, fail? now prompt for credentials because in this scenario they must have changed stuff and therefore have an idea about what they are doing.</i></p>

<p>Is ""trial and error"" the only way or is there a way to check authentication mode before connecting with credentials? (Using c# and sql2005 for what it's worth)</p>

<p>One solution is to use localization string to allows customization of the email contents, which email structure hardcoded somewhere.  This is undesireable as it does not allow the admin to modify the layout.</p>

<p>Another solution is to have Text/HTML modules set up to contain the email contents.  This has the benefit of allowing the admin to edit the text and layout.  It has the drawback that the admin might use a style that is in the CSS stylesheet that wouldn't be accessible to an email reader.</p>

<p>Any other thoughts on how to do this?  A 3rd party plugin or module would be fine.  For the email modules I've reviewed, they're more about setting up email campaigns.  For the ones I saw, I was not sure I could send emails programmatically from my custom module.</p>

<p>I am working with a multi-value pivoted set of data with has a sortable column.  The column is always stored as varchar in the DB, however, it has lookup knowledge of what that data type actually is. To simplify, in addition to strings the column can contain integers.</p>

<p>I have written a general-purpose (and working) sorting predicate as follows.</p>

<pre><code>Func&lt;MyObject, string&gt; sortClause = p =&gt; p.MyObjectProperties.Find(s =&gt; s.Name == theSortProperty).Value;

<pre><code>&lt;h3&gt;Order Details  &lt;input type=""button"" value=""Refund"" id=""btnRefund""  /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

<p>The desired result is that the text ""Order Details"" is at the left of the H3 Element and the button is at the right. The obvious solution is to add align:right to the button, however this causes the button to appear outside the H3 element or not inline with the text.</p>

<p><strong>Edit/Update:</strong>
I am sticking with nickf's answer (for now anyway) as I'm dealing with quite an old system with the H3 already styled in the external style sheet including background colour etc. There are also many instances of the H3 tag being used without any further elements nested in it and to me it does not make sense to have a div tag replicating the style of the H3 tag to accomodate this.</p>

<p>I don't want the UI to freeze while I try to connect to this remote database.</p>

<p>So knowing nothing about threading or thread-safety, here's my hamfisted example:</p>

<pre><code>RemoteDataContext rdt;

private void GetRemoteDataContext() {
    rdt = new RemoteDataContext(RemoteServerConnectionString);
}

private void FillFromRemoteDataContext() {
   lblTest.text = rdt.TestTable.First().TestField;

            FillFromRemoteDataContext();
        } catch { }  // ignore connection errors, just don't display data
    );
    t.Start;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So you should be able to tell from that what it is that I want to acheive.</p>

<p>My question is, what is the correct way to go about it?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thanks guys, now I have (in <code>Form1Shown</code>):</p>

<pre><code>BackgroundWorker bw = new BackgroundWorker();
bw.DoWork += new DoWorkEventHandler((sender, e) =&gt; {
    e.Result = null;
    try {
        e.Result = new RemoteDataContext(RemoteServerConnectionString);
    } catch { } // ignore connection errors, just don't display data
});
bw.RunWorkerCompleted += new RunWorkerCompletedEventHandler((sender, e) =&gt; {
    if (e.Result != null) {
        rdt = (RemoteDataContext)e.Result;
        FillFromRemoteDataContext();            
    }
});
bw.RunWorkerAsync();

<p>And it works, and as far as I understand it, there should be no threading related errors.</p>

<p>I am doing this because I have to have some research assistants compare some observations from two data sets that could not be matched because of name variants.  The idea is to throw up a name from one data set (say set A) and then based on a key match find all the names attached to that key in the other dataset (set B).  One a match has been identified I don't want to show the value from B again to speed things up for them.  Because there are 6,000 observations I also don't want them to have to start at the beginning of A each time they get back to work.  However, I can fix that by letting them chose to enter the last key from A they worked with.  But I really need to reduce B once the match has been identified  </p>

<p>I'm new to WCF and I thought it would be similar to ASP.NET web services, but I'm unable to call a method from client-side JavaScript.  My web form looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""form1"" runat=""server""&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;asp:ScriptManager ID=""ScriptManager1"" runat=""server""&gt;
         &lt;Scripts&gt;
            &lt;asp:ScriptReference Path=""~/test.js"" /&gt;
         &lt;/Scripts&gt;
         &lt;Services&gt;
            &lt;asp:ServiceReference Path=""~/MyService.svc"" /&gt;
         &lt;/Services&gt;
      &lt;/asp:ScriptManager&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;button onclick=""test()""&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My service's interface looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>namespace Test
{
    [ServiceContract(Namespace = ""Test"")]
    public interface IMyService
    {
        [OperationContract]
        void DoWork();

        [OperationContract]
        string SayHi();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here's its implementation:</p>

<pre><code>namespace Test
{
    [AspNetCompatibilityRequirements(RequirementsMode = AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Allowed)]
    public class MyService : IMyService
    {
        public void DoWork()
        {
        }

        public string SayHi()
        {
            return ""Hello, World!"";
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And finally the JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>function test() {
    Test.MyService.SayHi(SayHiSuccess, SayHiError);
}

function SayHiSuccess(result) {
    alert(result[0]);
}

function SayHiError(error) {
    alert(error.toString());
}
</code></pre>

<p>It appears that the service's SayHi() method never executes, although I'm not sure why or how to being troubleshooting.  Any suggestions?</p>

The layout of the ""game"" UI could be designed by an artist, generally someone who doesn't have access to the underlying code.</p>

"712364","1","","","2009-04-03 02:35:49","","1","933","<p>I have a table that tracks inventory data by each individual piece.  This is a simplified version of the table (some non-key fields are excluded):</p>

<pre><code>UniqueID,
ProductSKU, 
SerialNumber,
OnHandStatus,
Cost,
DateTimeStamp
</code></pre>

<p>Every time something happens to a given piece, a new audit record is created.  For example, the first time my product ABC gets added to inventory I get a record like this:</p>

<pre><code>1, ABC, 555, OnHand, $500, 01/01/2009 @ 02:05:22
</code></pre>

<p>If the cost of ABC serial number 555 changes, I get a new record:</p>

<pre><code>2, ABC, 555, OnHand, $600, 01/02/2009 @ 04:25:11
</code></pre>

<p>If the piece is sold, I get yet another record:</p>

<pre><code>3, ABC, 555, Sold, $600, 02/01/2009 @ 5:55:55
</code></pre>

<p>If a new piece of ABC is brought in, I get this record:</p>

<pre><code>4, ABC, 888, OnHand, $600, 02/05/2009 @ 9:01:01
</code></pre>

<p>I need to be able to get on-hand inventory value for a given set of products <em>at any point in time</em> as fast as possible.  </p>

<p>Using my example above, if I wanted to get my inventory value for product ABC as of 01/02/2009, I'd need to select, for each unique Product/SerialNumber combination, <strong>the single most recent</strong> record <strong>prior</strong> to 01/03/2009 with a status of ""OnHand"" and then add up the costs.  (I'm not 100% sure what this select statement would look like at this point, but I'm going to experiment a bit).</p>

<p><strong>My questions:</strong> is this a good structure for the type of audit table I'm describing?  That is, does it lend itself to fast queries if indexed appropriately?  (I'm trying to imagine what will happen when this table grows to millions of rows.)</p>

<p>Should I break out historical records into a separate table and only leave the most recent record for each ProductID/SerialNumber combo in the ""active"" table?</p>

The project loads fine, it runs fine, I don't see a single error or warning at any point, but when I save the form with the SStab on it, the SStab data isn't saved (it is completely gone).  Normally the relevant portion of the .frm file looks like this: </p>

<pre>   Begin TabDlg.SSTab SSTab1 
     Height          =   8895
     [1550 more lines of code for all the controls]
     Width           =   540
   End
   Begin VB.Menu FileMenu</pre>

<p>But lately it's getting cropped to:</p>

<pre>   Begin TabDlg.SSTab SSTab1 
   Begin VB.Menu FileMenu</pre>

<p>This is very frustrating! In my VB IDE, the frame, sstab, and all the controls are there, editable, running/compiling fine, no error messages at any point, but when you save the file, 1550 lines of precious sstab data just disappears - again, with no warning or error messages.  So if you exit and restart the IDE, you get a form load error because 60% of the code is now missing.  The log file points to the first error it finds (in this case a Begin TabDlg with no End) - there's no other info in it.  (The log file was generated after the code was deleted and saved, so it makes sense that it wouldn't be helpful.)</p>

<p>When I first posted this question, I thought it had to do with the number of controls, because it appeared after I added a control, and in my first few tests, seemed to disappear when that control (or other controls) was deleted.  Now I can't seem to get that form to save under any circumstances, even when I delete many controls (bringing the number of controls far below where it was when it was last stable).</p>

<p>I also tried deleting the SStab and moving all the controls to 4 different frames.  I successfully did that in the IDE, but when I saved, a huge chunk of the data (starting with a slider control) was missing.  So I have no fraking idea what is going on.</p>

<p>The problem is reproducible on two different PCs, so it doesn't appear to be a hardware/corrupt software VB install issue.</p>

Maybe a better example would be the SSL passphrase or any other password that must be shared among people performing administrative tasks. The fact is, root passwords and the like need to be generated and stored and usually more than one person needs to have access, sometimes those people work in different locations.

<p>The Windows Live ID spec indicates that I have to look for request headers ""login"", ""logout"", and ""clearcookie"".  The recommended code samples include a Response.Redirect, which doesn't seem to work when your page has extensive use of UpdatePanels:</p>

<pre><code>loginCookie = new HttpCookie(strLoginCookie);
loginCookie.Expires = DateTime.Now.AddYears(-10);
Response.Cookies.Add(loginCookie);
Response.Redirect(""default.aspx"");
Response.End();
</code></pre>

<p>Further, the clearcookie Action requires I write directly to the Response:</p>

<pre><code>public WindowsLiveLogin wll = new WindowsLiveLogin(key1, key2);

loginCookie = new HttpCookie(strLoginCookie);
loginCookie.Expires = DateTime.Now.AddYears(-10);
Response.Cookies.Add(loginCookie);

string type;
byte[] content;
wll.GetClearCookieResponse(out type, out content);
Response.ContentType = type;
Response.OutputStream.Write(content, 0, content.Length);
</code></pre>

<p>As a result, the response doesn't recognize it and the Windows Live logout feature times out, whether doing it via my logout button (logout Action) or the Windows Live site's logout feature (clearcookie Action). How can this be accomplished with static UpdatePanels and other AJAX controls in the markup?</p>

<p>I used this in a former AJAX project. I settled for not having logout functionality, which of course can be bypassed by clearing one's cookies.  Please tell me a more elegant way!</p>

Hopefully it will help to explain what im trying to achieve also. The problem im having is the javascript ""Vote"" link pretty much does nothing...lol... u click it, and nothing happens.

I'm struggling with whether or not I should keep my domain model clean of persistence information by leaving out foreign keys. I keep feeling like some of my ""model"" isn't really necessary and that performance is going to be an issue. For example:</p>

<p>In my db I have the following table:</p>

<pre><code>Posting
    Id
    StatusId
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Which has an FK relationship with this table:</p>

<pre><code>PostingStatus
    Id
    Name
</code></pre>

<p>In my model I've defined 2 classes:</p>

<pre><code>class Posting
{
    virtual int Id { get; set; }
    virtual PostingStatus Status { get; set; }
    // ..
}

class PostingStatus
{
    virtual int Id { get; set; }
    virtual string Name { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Does PostingStatus belong in my model? and in cases where I know the FK ahead of time, like updating a posting after a submit, isn't it a pretty heavy performance hit (or just useless work) to have nhibernate fetch a PostingStatus instance instead of just setting a FK?</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure this issue has been discussed before but I keep finding bits an pieces of the discussion that have shotty relevance. Thoughts or resources on this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>

The system will for the most part operate as follows:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Approximately 400k-500k rows - about 30 columns, mostly varchar(5-30) and datetime - will be uploaded each morning.  Its approximately 60MB while in flat file form, but grows steeply in the DB with the addition of suitable indexes.</li>
<li>Various statistics will be generated from the current day's data.    </li>
<li>Reports from these statistics will be generated and stored.</li>
<li>Current data set will get copied into a partitioned history table.</li>
<li>Throughout the day, the current data set (which was copied, not moved) can be queried by end users for information that is not likely to include constants, but relationships between fields.</li>
<li>Users may request specialized searches from the history table, but the queries will be crafted by a DBA.</li>
<li>Before the next day's upload, the current data table is truncated.</li>
</ol>

<p>This will essentially be version 2 of our existing system.  </p>

<p>Right now, we're using MySQL 5.0 MyISAM tables (Innodb was killing on space usage alone) and suffering greatly on #6 and #4.  #4 is currently not a partitioned tabled as 5.0 doesn't support it.  In order to get around the tremendous amount of time (hours and hours) its taking to insert records into history, we're writing each day to an unindexed history_queue table, and then on the weekends during our slowest time, writing the queue to the history table.  The problem is that any historical queries generated in the week are possibly several days behind then.  We can't reduce the indexes on the historical table or its queries become unusable.</p>

<p>We're definitely moving to at least MySQL 5.1 (if we stay with MySQL) for the next release but strongly considering PostgreSQL.  I know that debate has been done to death, but I was wondering if anybody had any advice relevant to this situation.  Most of the research is revolving around web site usage.  Indexing is really our main beef with MySQL and it seems like PostgreSQL may help us out through partial indexes and indexes based on functions.  </p>

<p>I've read dozens of articles about the differences between the two, but most are old.  PostgreSQL has long been labeled ""more advanced, but slower"" - is that still generally the case comparing MySQL 5.1 to PostgreSQL 8.3 or is it more balanced now?  </p>

<p>Commercial databases (Oracle and MS SQL) are simply not an option - although I wish Oracle was.</p>

<p>NOTE on MyISAM vs Innodb for us:
We were running Innodb and for us, we found it MUCH slower, like 3-4 times slower.  BUT, we were also much newer to MySQL and frankly I'm not sure we had db tuned appropriately for Innodb.  </p>

<p>We're running in an environment with a very high degree of uptime - battery backup, fail-over network connections, backup generators, fully redundant systems, etc.  So the integrity concerns with MyISAM were weighed and deemed acceptable.</p>

<p>In regards to 5.1:
I've heard the stability issues concern with 5.1.  Generally I assume that any recently (within last 12 months) piece of software is not rock-solid stable.  The updated feature set in 5.1 is just too much to pass up given the chance to re-engineer the project.</p>

<p>In regards to PostgreSQL gotchas:
COUNT(*) without any where clause is a pretty rare case for us.  I don't anticipate this being an issue.
COPY FROM isn't nearly as flexible as LOAD DATA INFILE but an intermediate loading table will fix that.
My biggest concern is the lack of INSERT IGNORE.  We've often used it when building some processing table so that we could avoid putting multiple records in twice and then having to do a giant GROUP BY at the end just to remove some dups.  I think its used just infrequently enough for the lack of it to be tolerable. </p>

<p>I <em>do</em> know a little bit. I believe it stands for ""Resource Acquisition is Initialization"". However, that name doesn't jive with my (possibly incorrect) understanding of what RAII is: I get the impression that RAII is a way of initializing objects on the stack such that, when those variables go out of scope, the destructors will automatically be called causing the resources to be cleaned up.</p>

<p>So why isn't that called ""using the stack to trigger cleanup"" (UTSTTC:)? How do you get from there to ""RAII""?</p>

<p>And how can you make something on the stack that will cause the cleanup of something that lives on the heap? Also, are there cases where you can't use RAII? Do you ever find yourself wishing for garbage collection? At least a garbage collector you could use for some objects while letting others be managed?</p>

<p>Discussion: I wrote a wrapper around a .NET dll from a third-party (LinkPointTransaction.dll  from FirstData), and I wrote some other assemblies that reference that wrapper.  As the code is running, a call to the third-party <code>LinkPointTransaction.LinkPointTxn.Send()</code> sends the transaction successfully to FirstData over the internet, but my application crashes w3wp.exe somewhere <strong><em>during</em></strong> that call, before it hits the next line.  It does not throw a managed exception that I can see; it just crashes.  Works fine everywhere on my machine except in IIS7.</p>

<p>I am running 64bit Vista Home Premium (IIS7), but I enabled 32bit apps in IIS, created a separate AppPool just for this web service, and have forced all of my assemblies to x86.  I have tried running the App Pool under my user account with Admin privileges instead of as the Network Service.  UAC is turned off.  I have tried Integrated and Classic modes.   I have explicitly opened the TCP/IP port in my local firewall that the LinkPointTransaction.dll uses to communicate with FirstData.  I even have shut my firewall off (behind a router).  </p>

<p>With any of these workarounds that I listed, it <strong><em>always</em></strong> works in a Windows app and also in a web service inside the VS Development Server, but <strong>never</strong> works in the local IIS server.</p>

<p>The AppPool for the IIS website is in Classic mode. (In response to

I also want to limit the file size to under 2mb, so I will test that(haven't implemented in code yet).  If the file they have selected passes, then I want the label to say ""File Accepted"", and store the file upload information for a later button click.  This will happen once the user has finished filling out the rest of the form.  Eventually, I will put an UpdateProgress control on the page while it is checking if the file is allowed.  I would rather not have it post back for this, so if I can get it to work, that would be great.  BTW, this will all work fine if I take the label out of the update panel.</p>

<p>Let me give you guys a sample of each file so you know what is what. I believe that my last try at figuring this out was not successful because I was confusing these files. They are all js and have the exact same syntax.</p>

<p>What I have are 2 javascript files. One is called ajax.js and has the folling syntax. it calls ajax.php.</p>

<pre><code>$(""#admEmpID"").bind(""change"", function(e){
  $.getJSON(""ajax.php?e="" + $(""#admEmpID"").val(),
        function(data)
        {
          $.each(data, function(i,item)
          {
            if (item.field == ""admEmpStatus"")
            {
              // ?? radio buttons
            }
            ............. etc
</code></pre>

<p><br><br><br>
The next file I have is this script and is called admEmp.js. I <em>think</em> that this one is for my form validation.</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
  $('.error').hide();
  $('input.text-input').css({backgroundColor:""#FFFFFF""});
  $('input.text-input').focus(function(){
    $(this).css({backgroundColor:""#FFDDAA""});
  });
  $('input.text-input').blur(function(){
    $(this).css({backgroundColor:""#FFFFFF""});
  });

  $("".admEmpBtn"").click(function() {
        // validate and process form
        // first hide any error messages
    $('.error').hide();

      var admEmpID = $(""input#admEmpID"").val();
    var admEmpStatus = $(""input[name='admEmpStatus']:checked"").val();

        $.ajax({
  type: ""POST"",...............etc.
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like to do is toggle my checkboxes according to the database results. If the result from the database is = 1 then the checkbox should be checked otherwise it should be unchecked.</p>

<p>These scripts that I have in place now will populate my textboxes from the values in the database so for someone like myself who has no idea what is happening with JQuery and its innerworkings, it is only natural for me to assume that the checkboxes will also be filled with the on/off values. Maybe I am incorrect. The last time I posted on SO looking for help, a guy mentioned that I needed to toggle the results with server side code. Is this correct or will JQuery do it for me?</p>

<p>I also have radio buttons in addition to the checkboxes that I need to show the values for as well. Just as a side note, the checkboxes are not grouped; they each have their own value.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help you guys can provide.</p>

<hr>

<p>OK. ""dz"" said that I should put ('#admCustRptDly').attr('checked', true); into my script to see if that will allow me to see the checked attribute but it doesn't. The database has a 0 for that checkbox so I sould be seeing no checkmark. I put that into the ajax.js file. Here is what it looks like now.</p>

<pre><code>    else if (item.field == ""admCustRptDly"" &amp;&amp; item.value == ""1"")
    {
    //  $(""checkbox#admCustRptDly"").attr(""checked"", ""checked"");
      $('#admCustRptDly').attr('checked', true);
    }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Here is what I did that makes me think that I may be making some progress. I put an alert inside of the condition and I do NOT get an alert. If I go to a customer that does have the db value set to 1, then I do get the alert. That's more than I was getting before. But again, I am still seeing the checkmark even though the data in the db = '0'</p>

<p>Imagine that I have a Author table and a Book table. I want to to retrieve all the authors whose name starts with ""a"" and all the books they've written. Then, client-side, generate an array of objects ""Author"" whose ""Books"" field is an array of objects ""Books"".</p>

<p>Two poor man solutions that come to my mind are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Retrieve all the authors, cycle through them on the client and execute an additional query to get all the books</li>
<li>""SELECT a.* FROM author a, book b WHERE a.name like 'A%' and b.author_id = a.id""</li>
</ol>

<p>The first solution is really database-side intensive (if i have 1000 authors, i have to execute 1001 queries).</p>

<p>The second requires some intensive work client-side, as the program would parse the result as it has the data common to Author repeated on each row.</p>

<p>Another solution would be to return multiple record sets from a stored procedure. I've never handled multiple record sets and I'm not sure that all the languages / adaptor classes support them.</p>

<p>Of course the situation can get worse if any author can have books <em>and</em> essays and every book can have sample pages and so on.</p>

<p>The aim is to eventually allow synchronisation of the database accross multiple servers (not using replication but probably the sync framework).<br>
Currently, all Primary Keys in the Access tables are autoincrement integer surrogates.  </p>

<p>I'm not asking about the process of upsizing but about whether I should use GUID or another codification for the PK (I know I could split the number range accross servers, but I don't want to do that and allow the PK to be created on the client if necessary, for instance in Offline mode).</p>

<p><strong>GUID</strong>  </p>

<p><em>Pro:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>standardised format.  </li>
<li>uniqueness assured (practically anyway)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Cons:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>not easy to manipulate in Access, especially when using them as filters for subforms or in controls.  </li>
<li>degrade INSERT performance due to their randomness.</li>
<li>has more than one representation: string, canonical form, binary that need to be converted.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Custom codification scheme</strong>  </p>

<p>I thought that maybe a scheme using a more uniform code as PK would avoid the performance penalty and, most importantly, ensure that the PK remains usable in form controls where necessary (and not require these conversions to/from string).</p>

<p>My idea for a codification scheme would be along the lines of a 10 character code split into:</p>

<ul>
<li>8 digits for a timestamp</li>
<li>4 digits for a unique client ID</li>
<li>2 digits as a random number for potential colisions
Each digit would be in base 34, composed of letters from A-Z and 2-9, avoiding <code>O</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>I</code> because of their similitude (in case we need to manually handle these PK, for instance during debugging).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Pro:</em> </p>

<ul>
<li>easier to handle manually when the case arises.  </li>
<li>don't require conversion between different representation since it's basically a string (so less existing code to adapt).</li>
<li>uniqueness assured (practically)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Cons:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>performance in JOIN hasn't been proven</li>
<li>performance in INSERT should be faster than GUID but not proven</li>
<li>Each server/client machine must be set its own UID, although that should not be too much of an issue.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, should I use GUID or another scheme for my PK?</p>

In the example they provide the following classes:</p>

<pre><code>[DataContract()]
public class Widget
{
    [DataMember]
    public string Id;
    [DataMember]
    public string Catalog;
}

[DataContract()]
public class Machine : Widget
{
    [DataMember]
    public string Maker;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the following interface:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceKnownType(typeof(Widget))]
[ServiceKnownType(typeof(Machine))]
[ServiceContract()]
public interface ICatalog
{
    [OperationContract]
    Hashtable GetItems();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when the proxy class is generated (using “Add Service Reference” / svcutil.exe), the “ServiceKnownType” attributes are omitted from the ICatalog proxy interface, resulting in getting an exception 
“The formatter threw an exception while trying to deserialize the message: … 
Add the type corresponding to 'Widget' to the list of known types”
To solve this problem I have to manually add the service known attributes to the generated proxy interface, which is a very bad solution, since the code regenerates when I update the reference.
The interesting thing in all this situation, is that if the GetItems operation would return object instead of Hashtable, or getting an object as a parameter , then the problem would be solved, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>[OperationContract]
object GetItems();
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>[OperationContract]
Hashtable GetItems(object obj);
</code></pre>

<p>results in presence of the “ServiceKnownType” attribute on ICatalog proxy interface.
Does anyone knows how to solve this problem?</p>

<pre><code>ObservableCollection&lt;MyClass&gt; myObjects;
</code></pre>

<p>and a ListBox called SillyListBox which is bound to this ObservableCollection via: <code>SillyListBox.ItemsSource = myObjects;</code>  The ListBox is defined in XAML as so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListBox x:Name=""SillyListBox""&gt;
 &lt;ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;
  &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
    &lt;MyControls:SillyControl TestString=""{Binding Name}"" /&gt;
  &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
 &lt;/ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;
&lt;/ListBox&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, whenever an object is added to the collection <code>myObjects</code>, a new SillyControl should be added to the ListBox and the property <code>TestString</code> of that SillyControl should be bound to the <code>Name</code> property of the <code>MyClass</code> object it represents.</p>

<p>This doesn't work.  It compiles fine, but when I run the program, it gives me a nasty runtime error - System.Windows.Markup.XamlParseException and below that something that says AG_E_PARSER_BAD_PROPERTY_VALUE.</p>

<p>Now, if I simply remove the Binding, give TestString a fixed value, for instance, <strong>the error disappears</strong>.  It is also possible for me to define a TextBlock control instead of a SillyControl and successfully use binding on it.  What on Earth is causing this to happen?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> As requested, here is how SillyControl is defined:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class SillyControl : UserControl
{
    private string testString;
    public string TestString
    {
        get { return testString; }
        set { testString = value; }
    }

    public SillyControl()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }
}

<p>The XAML is truly barebones.  I am using the default XAML, so it is nothing more than an empty Grid.</p>

<p>As far as I am aware I can do it along the following lines:</p>

<p>Following previous answers on stackoverflow I used umdh from the microsoft debugging tools to track down one memory leak.  However there is still more leaks and the results of umdh don't match up with my perfmon results.</p>

<p>First umdh does still reports this leak, the stack trace is:</p>

<pre><code>+   36192 ( 2082056 - 2045864)    251 allocs    BackTraceCB
+       4 (    251 -    247)    BackTraceCB allocations

    ntdll!RtlAllocateHeap+00000E9F
    MSVCR80!malloc+0000007A
</code></pre>

<p>This is no use as the first call is malloc, it doesn't say what called it.  I have my doubts about this leak as it is reported both when the application is processing transactions and when it is idle.  But I can clearly see that no memory is leaking when it is idle.  And the memory leaks reported when processing the transactions are not proportional to the transactions processed as perfmon reports.</p>

<p>umhd does not show any other leaks, although I know there is at least one more not shown.  I have just learn from searching the net that a windows application can have multiple heaps.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Could it be that umhd only reports memory usage from one of these heap?  eg the default or crt heap?  </li>
<li>How can I track memory usage in other heaps?  </li>
<li>And how do find out what dlls / modules are using the other heaps?</li>

    [self loadObjectsFromPlist];

    NSDictionary *objectData;
    while(objectData = [objectEnumerator nextObject]) {

    }
}

<p>As I'm not using any sections I return <code>1</code> in <code>numberOfSectionsInTableView</code> of the controller.</p>

<p>The <code>objectFromDictionary</code> method of ""<code>MyObject</code>"" assigns the data read from the <code>NSDictionary</code> to a new object. I tried retaining, copying etc. too, but that didn't change anything.</p>

<p>I get a <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code> in <code>tableView:numberOfRowsInSection</code> when calling <code>[objects count]</code>.

We use transactional replication to keep the read database up-to-date.</p>

<p>The two servers are very high-spec indeed (the write server has 32GB of RAM), and are connected via a fibre network.</p>

<p>When deciding upon this architecture we were led to believe that the latency for data to be replicated to the read server would be in the order of a few milliseconds (depending on load, obviously).  In practice we are seeing latency of around 2-5 seconds in even the simplest of cases, which is unsatisfactory.  By a simplest case, I mean updating a single value in a single row in a single table on the write db and seeing how long it takes to observe the new value in the read database.</p>

<p>What factors should we be looking at to achieve latency below 1 second?  Is this even achievable?</p>

<p>Alternatively, is there a different mode of replication we should consider?  What is the best practice for the locations of the data and log files?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to all for the advice and insight - I believe that the latency periods we are experiencing <em>are</em> normal; we were mis-led by our db hosting company as to what latency times to expect!  </p>

<p>We're using the technique described near the bottom of <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc500561.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">this MSDN article</a> (under the heading ""scaling databases""), and we'd failed to deal properly with this warning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The consequence of creating such specialized databases is latency: a write is now going to take time to be distributed to the reader databases. But if you can deal with the latency, the scaling potential is huge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We're now looking at implementing a change to our caching mechanism that enforces reads from the write database when an item of data is considered to be ""volatile"".</p>

<li><p>in complex applications <strong>I may have dozens of views on a screen</strong> at one time, yet I understand that in MVVM each view has one and only one ViewModel assigned to it to provide it with data and behavior, so <strong>how is it that the views can interact with each other</strong>, e.g. in the above validation example, what if back in the customer model we want to inform a particular ""MessageAreaView"" to display the message ""Last name may only contain 50 characters."", how to we communicate that up the stack to that particular view?</p></li>

On our production system I can see a strange behaviour in the verbose GC logs. After a period of normal behaviour the system can start rapidly allocating larger and larger blocks. The system starts to spend > 1000 ms to complete each GC, but blocks are being allocated so quickly that there is only a 30 ms gap between allocation failures.</p>

<ul>
<li>Each allocation failure slightly larger than the last by some integer amount x 1024 bytes. E.g. you might have 5 MB, and then a short while later 5 MB + 17 * 1024.</li>
<li>This can go on for up to 10 minutes.</li>
<li>The blocks tend to grow up to 8 to 14 MB in size before it stops.</li>
<li>It's a quad-core system, and I assume that it's now spending >95% of it's time doing GC with three cores waiting for the other core to complete GC. For 10 minutes. Ouch.</li>
<li>Obviously system performance dies at this point.</li>
<li>We have JSF, hibernate &amp; JDBC, web services calls, log4j output and not much else.</li>
</ul>

<p>I interpret this as likely to be something infrastructural rather than our application code. If it was a bad string concatenation inside a loop we would expect more irregular growth than blocks of 1024. If it was StringBuffer or ArrayList growth we would see the block sizes doubling. The growth is making me think of log buffering or something else. I can't think of anything in our app that allocations even 1 MB, let alone 14. Today I looked for logging backing up in memory before being flushed to disk, but the volume of logging statements over this period of GC thrashing was nowhere near the MB range.</p>

<p>Clearly the problem is with the excessive memory allocation rather than with the garbage collection, which is just doing its best to keep up. Something is allocating a large block and trying to grow it inefficiently in increments that are far too small.</p>

<p>Any ideas what might be causing all this when the system is under load? Anybody seen anything similar with Portal Server?</p>

<p>Note: for anybody who's interested it's starting to look like the cause is an occasional but enormous database query. It seems the culprit is either Hibernate or the JDBC driver.</p>

I would like to make sure that only my web pages can execute those web methods (ie I don't want people to execute those web methods directly - they could find out the url by looking at the source code of the javascript for example).<br>
What I'm planning to do is add a 'Key' parameter to all the webmethods. The key will be stored in the web pages in a hidden field and the value will be set dynamically by the web server when the web page is requested. The key value will only be valid for, say, 5 minutes. This way, when a webmethod needs to be executed, javascript will pass the key to the webmethod and the webmethod will check that the key is valid before doing whatever it needs to do.<br>
If someone wants to execute the webmethods directly, they won't have the key which will make them unable to execute them.<br>
What's your views on this? Is there a better solution? Do you forsee any problems with my solution?</p>

<p>MORE INFO: for what I'm doing, the visitors are not logged in so I can't use a session. I understand that if someone really wants to break this, they can parse the html code and get the value of the hidden field but they would have to do this regularly as the key will change every x minutes... which is of course possible but hopefully will be a pain for them.</p>

<p>EDIT: what I'm doing is a web application (as opposed to a web site). The data is retrieved through web methods (+jquery). I would like to prevent anyone from building their own web application using my data (which they could if they can execute the web methods). Obviously it would be a risk for them as I could change the web methods at any time.</p>

<p>I will probably just go for the referrer option. It's not perfect but it's easy to implement. I don't want to spend too much time on this as some of you said if someone really wants to break it, they'll find a solution anyway.</p>

<p>The XML looks somewhat like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Report&gt;
    &lt;Row&gt;
        &lt;Column name=""A long column name!""&gt;hey&lt;/Column&gt;
        &lt;Column name=""Another long column name!!""&gt;7&lt;/Column&gt;
        &lt;Column name=""A third freaking long column name!!!""&gt;hax&lt;/Column&gt;
        &lt;Column name=""Holy cow, can column names really be this long!?""&gt;true&lt;/Column&gt;
    &lt;/Row&gt;
    &lt;Row&gt;
        &lt;Column name=""A long column name!""&gt;yo&lt;/Column&gt;
        &lt;Column name=""Another long column name!!""&gt;53&lt;/Column&gt;
        &lt;Column name=""A third freaking long column name!!!""&gt;omg&lt;/Column&gt;
        &lt;Column name=""Holy cow, can column names really be this long!?""&gt;true&lt;/Column&gt;
    &lt;/Row&gt;
    &lt;!-- ... ~200k more rows go here... --&gt;
&lt;/Report&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the classes the XML is deserialized into look somewhat like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Report 
{
    public Row[] Rows { get; set; }
}
class Row 
{
    public Column[] Columns { get; set; }
}
class Column 
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Value { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the data is imported, a new string is allocated for every column name. I can see why that is so, but according to my calculations, that means a few duplicated strings make up some ~50% of the memory used by the imported data. I'd consider it a very good trade-off to spend some extra CPU cycles to cut memory consumption in half. Is there some way to have the <code>XmlSerializer</code> pool strings, so that duplicates are discarded and can be reclaimed the next time a gen0 GC occurs?</p>

<hr/>

<p>Also, some final notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I can't change the XML schema. It's an exported file from a third-party vendor.</p></li>
<li><p>I know could (theoretically) make a faster parser using an <code>XmlReader</code> instead, and it would not only allow me to do my own string pooling, but also to process data during mid-import so that not all 200k lines have to be saved in RAM until I've read the entire file. Still, I'd rather not spend the time writing and debugging a custom parser. The real XML is a bit more complicated than the example, so it's quite a non-trivial task. And as mentioned above - the <code>XmlSerializer</code> really does perform well enough for my purposes, I'm just wondering if there is an easy way to tweak it a little.</p></li>
<li><p>I could write a string pool of my own and use it in the <code>Column.Name</code> setter, but I'd rather not as (1) that means fiddling with auto-generated code, and (2) it opens up for a slew of problems related to concurrency and memory leaks.</p></li>
<li><p>And no, by ""pooling"", I don't mean ""interning"" as that can cause memory leaks.</p></li>

<p>In this case when i press build the compiler complains that it does not recognize ""SeriousGameFactory.Framework.ImageResource"". (Intellisense does not seem to be able to find the Framework namespace within the SeriousGameFactory Namespace)</p>

<p>I then change this manually to the following code</p>

<pre><code>using SeriousGameFactory.Framework;

<p>Now the project builds. (strange !??)
However when i open the form and work with it, visual studio autogenerates the following code.</p>

    partial class FormAvatarResourceSetEditor

<p>Hi</p>

<p>At the moment each Company on my website have 1 picture they can add to their profile.
I save that image into the database....its their Company Logo.</p>

<p>Now i want to allow them to add more pictures. Now i don’t know if i must save it all in the database or save it in folders???? </p>

<p>Reason why i think folders will be better is because there are so much nice articles with fancy silver light kinda features that i can use but all of them only cater for images saved in folders.</p>

<p>And since i am not THAT good its hard for me to change the code to look at the database instead of the examples that uses folders for image retrieval.</p>

<p>I would like to add something like this to my website (browsing through the images).
Any code examples for me on how to do this when images are saved in the database? I am using ASP.NET with VB.net.

I'm using Hibernate Core, Annotations &amp; Validator on PostgreSQL 8.3.</p>

<p>I have the following classes setup:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)
public class Entry {
    @EmbeddedId
    protected EntryPK       entryPK;
    @ManyToMany
    private Set&lt;Comment&gt;    comments    = new HashSet&lt;Comment&gt;();
...

@Embeddable
public class EntryPK implements Serializable {
    @ManyToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private Database    database;

    @Length(max = 50)
    @NotEmpty
    private String      pdbid;
...
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to see the Length constraint translated to a length contraint in my PostgreSQL database (which is working for other fields inside @Entity's rather than @Embeddable's) but it just doesnt seem to want to work..<br/>
Even using an @IdClass instead of @EmbeddedId and applying the Length constraint on the matching field in the @Entity did not fix this problem: the database field is still varchar 255 (about 250 too large for my needs).<br/>
Some might say I shouldn't care about this level of detail, but my OCD side is refusing to let it go.. ;) Is it just not possible to use Hibernate Validator Annotations inside an EmbeddedId and have hbm2ddl apply the constraints to the database fields?</p>

<p>We are currently working on a smart client in Flex and a backend in Java. On the server we have a service layer exposed to the client that offers CRUD operations amongst some other service methods. I understand that in DDD these services should be repositories and services should be used to handle use cases that do not fit inside a repository. Right now, we mimic these services on the client behind an interface and inject implementations (Webservices, RMI, etc) via an IoC container.</p>

<p>So some questions arise:</p>

<ul>
<li>should the server expose repositories to the client or do we need to have some sort of a facade (that is able to handle security for instance)</li>
<li>should the client implement repositories (and DDD in general?) knowing that in the client, most of the logic is view related and real business logic lives on the server. All communication with the server happens asynchronously and we have a single threaded programming model on the client.</li>
<li>how about mapping client to server objects and vice versa? We tried DTO's but reverted back to exposing the state of our objects and mapping directly to them. I know this is considered bad practice, but it saves us an incredible amount of time)</li>
</ul>

<p>In general I think a new generation of applications is coming with the growth of Flex, Silverlight, JavaFX and I'm curious how DDD fits into this.</p>

<p>We need the ComboBox to respond to one of the default events, so when for example the user writes 'N' the value in the ComboBox will be the first Value starting by 'N'.

This technique is very used in web Application (for example in Google when you put the first word you will get a droped down list containing the suggestions).

<p>Adding markers is easy, I just <code>push()</code> the newly created object onto the array (<code>markers.push(marker)</code>);</p>

<p>However, when it comes to removing an arbitrary marker from the array, given an index of the slot, it doesn't behave as expected. My function is:</p>

<pre><code>function deleteMarker(markerIndex) {
    if (markerIndex!='' &amp;&amp; markerIndex&gt;=0 &amp;&amp; markerIndex&lt;markers.length) {
        if (confirm('Do you really want to remove this marker from the map?')) {

<p>I have no previous experience with the splice() function, but looking at <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_splice.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">its description @ w3schools</a> it seems to be pretty straight-forward. However, I get the following behaviour:</p>

<p><code>markers.splice()</code> does nothing. So what am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>And also, when <code>markerIndex</code> is 0 no confirmation box is shown. At first I assumed the lengthy if-condition evaluated to false and so the whole code block was skipped, however, using Firebug to step through the calls I found out that the condition holds (of course) for index 0 when array is non-empty, next step reveals that the <code>if (confirm(...))</code> and <code>alert('deleting...)</code> are <em>skipped</em> and <code>markers.splice()</code> is called (but nothing happens). This behaviour is so strange I decided to open this question.</p>

<p><em>Can anyone please clarify what's going on?</em></p>

<p>I thought that deleting markers will be the easiest bit of functionality one could do. I can add them, edit their contents, even <em>clear all markers</em> (<code>pop()</code>-ing markers off the <code>markers</code> array until empty) and all works nicely.</p>

<p>EDIT:
Just in case it happens to someone else: we found out that the computer didn't have the last version of MDAC (2.8 SP1). It's very likely that the customer reinstalled the computer and didn't update Windows: when we ran Windows Update, the problem <em>magically</em> (from the customer point of view...) was fixed.
We don't know exactly which version of MDAC was installed, but could have been 2.6 or less, since I know our applications have problems with older versions of MDAC.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to convert these various formats so that the data that gets stored in my business entity is ""1.5"" (point as decimal separator)?</p>

<hr>

<p>You guys were right - it made sense to use Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture instead of Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture and decimal.TryParse instead of int.TryParse.</p>

<p>But these changes would still not solve my problem. And after playing around with the code some more, I can now simplify the issue to this:</p>

<p>I am using a telerik RadNumericTextBox control which enforce users to use the correct format based on their culture. So, when Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture is set to ""ro-RO"", it will only accept the ""1,5"" format, and when it's set to ""en-GB"", it will only accept the ""1.5"" format.   </p>

<p>Here's the code I am using now:</p>

<pre>
decimal exchangeRate;
decimal.TryParse(txtExchangeRate.Text, out exchangeRate);
entity.ExchangeRate = exchangeRate;
</pre>

<p>Case 1: current culture is ""en-GB"" - accepted input is ""1.5"" , exchangeRate is set to 1.5 - everything works fine.</p>

<p>Case 2: current culture is ""ro-RO"" - accepted input is ""1,5"" , but after executing the decimal.TryParse... line, <strong>exchangeRate is set to 15</strong> - wrong, obviously.
I should also mention that in this case, the value of txtExchangeRate.Text is also shown as ""1.5"" in my Watch window.</p>

<p>So, it looks like decimal.TryParse will take into consideration the current culture, but I can't find a way to actually make it work properly for me. Any suggestions?  </p>

    object Retrieve(string name);

public class WidgetManager
{
    public WidgetManager(IDataStore dataStore) { }
    // Other stuff

<p>If a second assembly tries to create a GizmoManager and a WidgetManager, it can't because it has no way to get hold of a DBStore (since it is internal not public).</p>

<p>The following don't work AFAICS:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Make DBStore and IDataStore public. Bad because the client assembly can then bypass GizmoManager/WidgetManager and access the DB however it likes.  </li>
<li>Don't pass in an IDataStore to the GizmoManager and WidgetManager constructors. Bad because it reduces testability (you can't easily pass in a MockDataStore).  </li>
<li>Do something magic with factories. Doesn't seem to solve anything because you need to pass the same IDataStore to both GizmoManager and WidgetManager and thus the client assembly still needs to assign an IDataStore to a variable (which it can't because IDataStore is internal).</li>

<p>The background is that we are discussing a migration from PVCS Dimensions to Subversion, and the main feature cited as missing in Subversion is ""Design Parts"". A design part is an arbitrary collection of files that can be handled together, e.g. all the source files needed for a subproject.</p>

<p>One idea to replace this is by copy operations in a Makefile, which copy the relevant files into a branch. But if all files are copied separately this may lead to a lot of revisions, which may clutter the history, so it would be nice to avoid that.</p>

<p><b>EDIT:</b>
Some more background information:</p>

<p>The project consists of several (5-10) subprojects which are released separately, but which share some common source files and external libraries imported from other projects. </p>

<p>One reason cited for the design parts is restricting dependencies on source files,
another is for managing the products of subprojects, so that all of them can be updated in version control in one operation. Both kinds of files are somewhat sprinkled across directories.</p>

<p>We are about 5 developers on the project.</p>

<p>I've tried lots of iterations of, eg declaring ""var jsonOutput"" at start of script and then making ""jsonOutput =  o"" but that just leaves jsonOutput undefined. If I try to return jsonOutput then I don't know where it's being returned to, I can't use it anyway.</p>

<p>Do I need to make a global variable? I've tried a simple ""global jsonOutput"" declaration but it doesn't seem to be modified inside the function.</p>

That is to say, how to adjust the price of a contract based on the amount of call and put orders. The basic algorithm I am using now is of two kinds:</p>

<p>For yes/no events (i.e., either the events happens or doesn't) I am just taking the percentage of people who say it will happen, and make that the contract price. If 90% say it will happen, the price in $90 (fake money). The contracts cash out at $100 if the event occurs, $0 is it doesn't.</p>

<p>For events that have a certain value (let's say a athlete's ""power rating""), I set an IPO (my guess as to where the thing will cash out) and the apply a percentage increase to the IPO. So if there are 80% more calls than puts then I add 80% to the IPO. I add a little stabilizer so that the early orders don't cause huge jumps (i.e, the first order doubling the price).</p>

<p>Bear in mind this isn't a real market, the players don't trade contracts, they just make call or put orders against the system.</p>

<p>The first thought I had was that I should weigh the more recent calls and puts as they have nore relevant information presumably (like say the athlete just broke his foot). These guys would know more than the guy who bought a contract three months ago.</p>

<p>Example copied from a jython-console:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = java.lang.Boolean(""True"");
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(b)
&lt;type 'javainstance'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(b, java.lang.Boolean);
1
</code></pre>

<p>So far, everything is fine but if I put the object in an ArrayList</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = java.util.ArrayList();
&gt;&gt;&gt; l.add(b)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(l.get(0))
&lt;type 'int'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>the object is transformed into a python-like boolean (i.e. an int) and... </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(l.get(0), java.lang.Boolean)
0
</code></pre>

<p>which means that I can no longer see that this was once a java.lang.Boolean.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong></p>

<p>I guess what really want to achieve is to get rid of the implicit conversion from Java-types to Python-types when passing objects from Java to Python. I will give another example for clarification.</p>

<p>A Python module:</p>

<pre><code>import java

import IPythonModule

class PythonModule(IPythonModule):

    def method(self, data):
        print type(data);
</code></pre>

<p>And a Java-Class that uses this module:</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.ArrayList;

import org.python.core.PyList;
import org.testng.annotations.*;

import static org.testng.AssertJUnit.*;

public class Test1 {

    IPythonModule m;

    @BeforeClass
    public void setUp() {
        JythonFactory jf = JythonFactory.getInstance();
        m = (IPythonModule) jf.getJythonObject(
                ""IPythonModule"",
        ""/Users/sg/workspace/JythonTests/src/PythonModule.py"");
    }

    @Test
    public void testFirst() {
        m.method(new Boolean(""true""));
    }   
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here I will see the output 'bool' because of the implicit conversion, but what I would really like is to see 'javainstance' or 'java.lang.Boolean'. If you want to run this code you will also need the JythonFactory-class that can be found <a href=""http://wiki.python.org/jython/JythonMonthly/Articles/September2006/1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

Assume that a <strong>bootloader</strong> exists which is capable of loading the code to any location in RAM and start execution at that address. 
To be precise, what should be the compiler(<strong>GCC</strong>) flags? Is there a need for a map file?</p>

<p>A sample helloworld application would be most welcome :)</p>

<p>Just to elaborate my point,<br>
let the main() method be an empty infinite while loop to ensure that no <strong>OS</strong> specific or standard library calls are used. The desired o/p is a hang. With the usual <strong>GCC</strong> options the bootloader would definitely fail to load the executable telling it is invalid <strong>ELF</strong> format. However by passing <em>-dN</em> option to the linker will make it a valid <strong>ELF</strong>. More compiler/linker options are required to make it hang and not crash!!  What exactly are those compiler options?</p>

<pre><code>file.c:
int main()
{
    while(1);
}

    gcc -c  -nostdinc -fno-builtin  file.c<br>

<p>In <code>R</code>, I can compute the eigenvalues as in the following toy example:</p>

<pre><code>m&lt;-matrix( c(13,2, 5,4), ncol=2, nrow=2 )
eigen(m, only.values=1)
$values
[1] 14  3
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone know what algorithm it uses? </p>

<p>Are there any other (open-source) packages that compute the eigenvalue?</p>

The problem is that I want to create dynamic folders at run time.  Folder names will be entered via a TextBox and output will be displayed in a TreeView. The form will submit if I enter the first folder name into textbox1 and click the ""Add Folder"" button.  When I submit multiple folders with the same name, the output should be an indexed increment of the name (e.g., FooFolder, FooFolder(2), FooFolder(3), etc). There are two events: Add Folder Event and Remove Folder Event.  If I select a particular child folder and click on the ""Remove folder"" button, the folder will be removed. For adding a folder I have written the following code:</p>

<pre><code>TreeNode tnode = new TreeNode();
if (TreeView1.Nodes.Count &gt; 0)
        {
            int found = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; TreeView1.Nodes.Count; i++)
            {
                if (TreeView1.Nodes[i].Text == TextBox1.Text)
                    found += 1+i;
            }
            if (found &gt; 0)
            {
                tnode.Text = TextBox1.Text + found.ToString();
            }
            else
            {
                tnode.Text = TextBox1.Text;
            }
        }
        else
        {
            tnode.Text = TextBox1.Text;
        }
        TreeView1.Nodes.Add(tnode);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my code, the ChildNode index is not incrementing; it is always 1, like this:</p>

<pre><code>Sumit
Sumit(1)
Sumit(1)
Sumit(1)
Amit
Amit(5)
Amit(5)
Amit(5)
</code></pre>

<p>In the treeview, I have set <code>ImageSet=""XPFileExplorer""</code>.  So the output should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>-Root
        -Sumit(Parent1)
                  NewFolder
                  NewFolder(2)
                  NewFolder(3)
                  NewFolder(4)
                  NewFolder(5)
         -Amit(Parent2)
                  FooFolder
                  FooFolder(2)
                  FooFolder(3)
                  FooFolder(4)
                  FooFolder(5)
</code></pre>

<p>If I delete any child folder, say, Newfolder(3) and Newfolder(4) and create these same folders under the same Sumit(Parent1), the index should be Newfolder(3),Newfolder(4).  If I create one more NewFolder under Sumit with same name then the index should be NewFolder(6).</p>

<p>Could somebody please modify my code to get this desired output?</p>

<p>On page load I'm displaying a progress meter after which I do a post back in order to handle the actual loading of the page.  During the post back, based on certain criteria I'm disabling certain links on the page.  However, the links won't disable.  I noticed that if I force the links to disable the first time in (through debug) that the links disable just fine.  However, I don't have the data I need at that time in order to make the decision to disable.</p>

<p>ob_post.post is an obout js function that does a normal postback and then follows up with a call to the server method named by the second param. then followed by the call to a JavaScript method named by the third param.  The first parameter is the page to post back to.  A value of null posts back to the current page.</p>

<p>The post back is working fine.  All methods are called in the correct order.  The code that gives me trouble is under the code behind in bold.  (somelink.disabled = True does not actually disable the link)  Again, if I debug and force the disabling of the link to happen the first time in, it disables.  Does anyone know what I might do to get around this?</p>

<p>Note that the error message <em>""An explicit value for the identity column in table '#TmpMyTable' can only be specified <strong>when a column list is used</strong> and IDENTITY_INSERT is ON.""</em> - I specifically don't want to use a column list as explained above.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>
Tried <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/713960/how-to-drop-identity-property-of-column-in-sql-server-2005/714247#714247"">the suggestion from Mike</a> but this gave the same error:</p>

<pre><code>-- Create empty temp table
SELECT *
INTO #Tmp
FROM (SELECT
      m1.*
      FROM TestTable                 m1
          LEFT OUTER JOIN TestTable  m2 ON m1.ID=m2.ID
      WHERE 1=0
 ) dt

INSERT INTO #Tmp
SELECT TOP 1 * FROM TestTable
</code></pre>

<p>As for why I want to do this: MyTable is a staging table which can contain a large number of rows to be merged into another table.  I want to process the rows from the staging table, insert/update my main table, and delete them from the staging table in a loop that processes N rows per transaction.  I realize there are other ways to achieve this.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3</strong></p>

<p>I couldn't get <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/713960/how-to-drop-identity-property-of-column-in-sql-server-2005/714247#714247"">Mike's solution</a> to work, however it suggested the following solution which does work: prefix with a non-identity column and drop the identity column:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CAST(1 AS NUMERIC(18,0)) AS ID2, *
INTO #Tmp
FROM TestTable
WHERE 1=0
ALTER TABLE #Tmp DROP COLUMN ID

INSERT INTO #Tmp
SELECT TOP 1 * FROM TestTable
</code></pre>

<p>Mike's suggestion to store only the keys in the temporary table is also a good one, though in this specific case there are reasons I prefer to have all columns in the temporary table.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>After further investigation it seems that iTextSharp's HTML to PDF conversion capability is limited to some very simple HTML documents. There's a nice Java project called <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/flying-saucer//"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Flying Saucer</a> which handles complex HTML documents. So I tried using it with <a href=""http://www.ikvm.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IKVM</a> and it worked very well. The only problem is that it feels somehow a dirty solution. Adding 31MB of assembly code for HTML to PDF conversion seems quite much. Are there any better and ""free"" alternatives to handle this scenario.</p>

<p>I convert the XML to a HierarchicalData Object in the WebService result handler. I also dynamically build the columns for the AdvancedDataGrid, since it used to display different columns depending on the user input. However, I also need to display a totals ""row"" at the bottom of the AdvancedDataGrid. I cannot figure out how to convert my XMLListCollection to a GroupingCollection, and thereby create a totals row this way, so, I actually calculate the totals in the WebService and return this as a node in the XML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;totals value=""4100"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I use this ""totals"" data to populate a second AdvancedDataGrid with no headers that sits directly below the first ADG, so that it ""appears"" to be the ""last row"" of the first ADG. Both ADGs use the same Bindable columns Array:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;mx:AdvancedDataGrid id=""reportADG"" dataProvider=""{__model.reportData}""
    columns=""{__model.adgDrillColumns}"" width=""100%"" height=""100%"" /&gt;

I could not unfortunately just ""override"" it since the implementation logic was bound strictly to that particular method implementation in the base class.</p>

<p>My natural idea was to first ""unbind"" the original event handler from the event and then to bind my own brand-new method. So I tried to use the ""-="" operator like:</p>

<pre><code>myObject.SomeEvent -= new EventHandler (BaseClass.SomeEventHandler)
</code></pre>

<p>at which point the compiler complainer that it had no access to the private method SomeEventHandler. Since the base class was a part of the library I did not really want to modify its implementation (though simply as it seems by just turning ""private"" into ""protected"");</p>

<p>It's so simple to attach an event handler to an event. Why is it so difficult to get rid of one?</p>

<p>Why I wanted it? Because the base implementation was casing some problems (just did not handle our particular case) so I wanted to redefine it. But even after I attached my event handler the base implementation was getting executed anyway. Since it was doing some kind of Redirect, my own implementation was never going to run since the request processing was being broken at server after redirect.</p>

<p>Is there anyway to get rid of an event handler in a base class from a library without modifying its implementation?</p>

<p>Before reinventing the wheel, I'd like to know if any of you have experience with storing this kind of data in a relational DB. Currently I'm using MySQL, but I believe any good solution should be easily adapted to any RDBMS, right?</p>

<p>I'm looking to support the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Online billing system</strong> - once each invoice is paid, earnings for referrals are calculated and they will be able to cash-out. This includes, of course, having the possibility of browsing invoices / payments online.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paid options vary</strong> - they are different in nature and in costs (which will vary sometime), so commissions should be calculated based on each final invoice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keeping track of referrals</strong> (relationship between users, date in which it was referred, and any other useful information - any ideas?)</p></li>
<li><p>A simple way to <strong>access historical referring data</strong> (how much have been paid) or accrued commissions.</p></li>
<li><p>In the future, I might offer to <strong>exchange accrued cash for subscription renewal</strong> (covering the whole of the new subscription or just a part of it, having to pay the difference if needed)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple levels</strong> - I'm thinking of paying something around 10% of direct referred earnings + 2% the next level, but this may change in the future (add more levels, change percentages), so I should be able to store historical data.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that I'm not planning to use this in any other project, so I'm not worried about it being ""plug and play"".</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>checking that tables don't already exist before creating them </li>
<li>checking that columns don't already exist before creating or renaming </li>
<li>transactions with rollback on error</li>
<li>If you drop tables that exist before creating them anew, drop their dependencies first too, and don't forget to recreate them after</li>
<li>Using CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE instead of CREATE PROCEDURE or ALTER PROCEDURE if your flavor of SQL supports it</li>
<li>Maintain an internal versioning scheme, so the same SQL just doesn't get run twice in the first place. This way you always know where you're at by looking at the version number.</li>
<li><p>Export the existing data to INSERT statements and completely recreate the entire DB from scratch.</p></li>

<p>Thread one manages the client connections. (There is only one client and one server)<br>
I call it my server thread.</p>

<p>Thread two manages sending messages to the client.  I call it my message processor thread.</p>

<p>Thread one is responsible, among other things sending a heartbeat to the client periodically.  </p>

<p>When programming I made an assumption that the sockets weren't thread safe, but the buffers were, and as long as I was using seperate buffers for the server and processor threads I would be fine. </p>

<p>I also made the assumption that the ""PrintWriter"" was analogous to the socket buffer in Java.  </p>

<p>Under these assumptions I wrote this function to send a heartbeat:</p>

<pre><code>public void sendHeartBeat(){
        logger.info(""Sending a hearbeat!"");
        PrintWriter printWriter=null;
        try {
            printWriter = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            logger.info(e.toString());
        }
        if(printWriter!=null){
            printWriter.print(""HEARTBEAT#"");
            printWriter.flush();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The other thread, the ""processor"" one does something similar in that it does:</p>

<pre><code>printWriter=new PrintWriter(theServer.getClientSocket().getOutputStream());
</code></pre>

<p>In this manner I would create a new ""buffer"" every time I wished to send a heartbeat, and my messages would never get overwritten.</p>

<p>Unfortuneately this does not seem to be the case.  And I get an message coming through the pipe like this:
  dsgdsbHEARTBEAT#sdg</p>

<p>This causes a core dump later.</p>

<p>Here are my questions:</p>

<p>1) Sockets are obviously not thread safe, but are the PrintWriters I get from them thread safe?  Or is it just returning the same PrintWriter?</p>

<p>2) What is analogous to the socket buffer in Java?  How should I think about this problem?</p>

<p>3) How do I make it so that these threads do not write to the same buffer on the socket? </p>

Secondly, I either need to keep all my projects at the same depth relative to the root to use the relative path, or use an absolute path, which dictates a checkout location on other users' machines (and on continuous integration servers/build agents).</p>

<p>Does anyone have a better solution than this, other than going through each project setting strong naming in the project file?</p>

<p>In my application, users should be able to identify objects based on a user-friendly ID. So, for example, if they want to get a specific product without typing in the full name, they can use the product's ID. GUIDs aren't easy to remember for something like that.</p>

<p>The solution I've been thinking about is to use both a GUID and an auto-incrementing integer. The GUID would be the row's primary key, while the auto-incrementing integer would be an index used by the application's filtering functions. All SQL SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE statements would use the GUID, however.</p>

<p>The main reason I want to use GUIDs is to prevent clashes when merging two databases. If Database #1 and Database #2 both have a Product #2, the importer script would have to change the ID and all foreign keys referring to it. With GUIDs, I only have to change the user-friendly ID in the table itself, while foreign keys would use the GUID unique to each imported record and will therefore work without modification.</p>

<p>So, my question is: are there any major problems (besides the size of the GUID field and easy page fragmentation) with having an auto-incrementing integer index and a GUID primary key?</p>

<p>I have a table of approximately 200,000 address locations hosted on a <strong><em>SQL 2000 Server</em></strong>. This table has a huge problem with duplicate data in the table caused by invalid input from various parties over the years. I need to output a list of duplicate records so I can begin the long process of cleaning them up.</p>

<p>So consider the following table structure:</p>

<pre><code>Table Company(   
  CompanyId NVarChar(10) Not Null Constraint PK_Locations Primary Key,   
  CompanyName NVarChar(30),   
  CompanyAddress NVarChar(30),   
  CompanyCity NVarchar(30), 
  CompanyState Char(2),   
  CompanyZip NVarChar(10),   
  DateCreated DateTime, 
  LastModified DateTime,  
  LastModifiedUser NVarChar(64) 
)
</code></pre>

<p>For the first parse I'm not even going to worry about typos and variations of spelling yet which is going to be a greater nightmare down the road that I haven't even got the first clue about solving yet.</p>

<p>So for this part a record is considered to be duplicate when multiple records match on the following conditions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(CompanyName Or CompanyAddress) And CompanyCity And CompanyState</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zip is excluded because so many of the locations are missing zip/postal codes and so many are entered incorrectly that it just makes for a far less accurate report if I include them.</p>

<p>I realize that there may legitimately be multiple locations for a company within a single city/state [for instance McDonalds, just off the top of my head], and there may legitimately be multple companies at a single address within a city and state [for instance inside a shopping mall or office building], but for now we will consider that these at least warrant some level of human attention and will include them in the report.</p>

<p>Matches on single fields are a piece of cake, but I'm coming unstuck when I get to multiple fields, especially when some are conditional.</p>

"714579","1","","","2009-04-03 16:00:23","","0","137","<p>I have a large SQL server table that looks something like this:</p>

<pre>
ImageId int
Page int
FSPath varchar(256)
ImageFrame int
...
</pre>

<p>The table stores an entry for each page of a number of image files.  This is done to enable the table to represent images where each page is represented by a different file, and multi-page image files that contain the pages within the same file.  When I am dealing with a multi-page setup, the value of the FSPath column is exactly duplicated for each page within the same document which is eating up a lot of space (this table alone is currently ~5GB).  It seems very wasteful to be duplicating the data in this way, but I haven't been able to find an alternate solution that I'm satisfied with.</p>

<p>The usage pattern for this table is dominated by lookups based on the primary key (ImageId/Page) for the path (and other columns) but I also need to be able to efficiently handle insertion of new data and occasional deletion.  </p>

<p>If I create a lookup table for the path elements and insert an path element id into the pages table I would need to index it both by the Id and by the path, which would hurt the scenario where there is a distinct path piece for each page, and complicate the insertion of new data where the path may or may not exist in the lookup table.  Furthermore, deletion of any row in the main pages table would require that I clean up the associated path entry if it is no longer used.</p>

<p>I had been hoping that I could create an updateable view of the joined tables and let SQL Server do the magic for me, but I get the message: View or function 'Scrap.dbo.PageView' is not updatable because the modification affects multiple base tables.  Trying to perform an insert.</p>

<p>Is there a reasonable way to do this that I'm just missing, or am I out of luck?</p>

I am mostly concerned with getting git-svn to perform merges in such a way that the svn:mergeinfo property is correctly set in the subversion repo. Is this possible?</p>

<p>Here is what I have done so far:</p>

<pre><code># Checkout the SVN repo.
$ git svn clone svn://server/project1 -T trunk -b branches -t tags

# Make sure we are working on trunk.
$ git reset --hard remotes/trunk

# Modify the working copy.
$ vim file.txt

# Commit locally to the git repo.
$ git commit -a

# Push the commits back to the SVN server.
$ git svn dcommit
Committing to svn://server/project1/trunk ...
    M   file.txt

    M   file.txt
r178 = b6e4a3a0c28e7b9aa71d8058d96dcfe7c8a2b349 (trunk)
</code></pre>

<p>Now how would I go about merging that particular commit into one of the subversion branches?  Again, it is very important to me that git properly set the svn:mergeinfo property when committing the change.</p>

"714590","1","714682","","2009-04-03 16:03:16","","5","18670","<p>Our server application receives information about rows to add to the database at a rate of 1000-2000 rows per second, all day long.  There are two mutually-exclusive columns in the table that uniquely identify a row: one is a numeric identifier called 'tag' and the other is a 50character string called 'longTag'.  A row can have either a tag or a longTag; not both.</p>

<p>Each row that comes in off the socket may or may not already exist in the table.  If it exists, that row must be updated with the new information.  If it doesn't exist, it must be added.  We are using SQL 2005 and in a few cases even SQL 2000, so we cannot use the new MERGE keyword.</p>

<p>The way I am doing this now is to build a giant DELETE statement that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>DELETE from MyRecords
WHERE tag = 1
OR tag = 2
OR longTag = 'LongTag1'
OR tag = 555
</code></pre>

<p>...where each incoming row has its own 'OR tag = n' or 'OR longTag = 'x'' clause.</p>

<p>Then I perform an XML Bulk Load using ISQLXMLBulkLoad to load all the new records at once.</p>

<p>The giant DELETE statement sometimes times out, taking 30 seconds or longer.  I'm not sure why.</p>

<p>As records come in off the socket they must either be inserted or they must replace existing rows.  Is the way I'm doing it the best way to do it?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  The ratio of new rows to replacement rows is going to be very heavily slanted toward new rows.  In data I have seen coming from production, there will typically be 100-1000 new rows for each correction.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>: Both the inserts and the deletes must be handled as a single transaction.  If either the insert or the delete fails, they must both be rolled back, leaving the table in the same state it was in before the inserts &amp; deletes began.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong>: Regarding NULL tags.  I need to first briefly describe the system a little more.  This is a database for a trading system.  MyTable is a trades table containing two kind of trades: so-called ""day trades"" and so-called ""opening positions.""  Day trades are simply trades -- if you were an options trader and you did a trade, that trade would be a day trade in this system.  Opening positions are basically a summary of your portfolio up until today.  Both opening positions and day trades are stored in the same table.  Day trades have tags (either longTags or numeric tags), and opening positions do not.  There can be duplicate rows for opening positions -- that is fine &amp; normal.  But there cannot be duplicate rows for day trades.  If a day trade comes in with the same tag as some record already in the database, then the data in the table is replaced with the new data.</p>

<p>So there are 4 possibilities for the values in tag &amp; longTag:</p>

<p>1) tag is non-zero &amp; longTag is empty: this is a day trade with a numeric identifier.
2) tag is zero and longTag has a non-empty character value.  This is a day trade with an alphanumeric identifier.
3) tag is zero and longTag is empty: this is an opening position.
4) tag is non-zero and longTag has a non-empty character value.  This is prevented from every happening by our server software, but if it were to happen the longTag would be ignored and it would be treated the same as case #1.  Again, this does not happen.</p>

By default, this service uses en-US culture settings, which means the decimals separator will be ""."".</p>

<p>I have a class that has a <code>System.Double</code> property.
If I request data using a culture that uses "","" as decimal separator, I get a <code>SerializationException</code> while trying to deserialize the value for this property, when parsing the <code>System.Double</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""There was an error deserializing the object of type XXX. The value '1,6276' cannot be parsed as the type 'double'.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is certainly because an invariant culture is used while parsing the Double.
I hoped that setting the correct culture on the current thread would fix this, but it didn't.</p>

<p>So the services will break for any cultures that is not using ""."" as decimal separator.</p>

<p>Will appreciate help.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>For role security, there are user groups on the servers that users are added into (so you need to be added into the group on the test and production machine). These user groups are synchronized into user roles on SQL 2000 itself. Roles are granted execute permissions to stored procedures as needed to prevent any access violations.</p>

<p>At the web application level, we use basic authentication (which authenticates against our Active Directory) and have identity impersonation turned on. The connection string to the database uses Integrated Security. This creates an environment where the web application connects to the database as the user logged in, which will enforce database security on stored procedures being called. It also allows us to use the typical User.IsInRole() method to perform authorization within the application itself.</p>

<p>There are several problems with this. The first is that only our server administrators have access to the user groups on the machine, so updating role security, or adding additional users is out of the hands of the application administrators. In addition, the only way to get the role was to call a SQL procedure called ""xp_logininfo"" which is locked down in SQL 2005. While I don't know the full details, our DBA tells us that this general model doesn't play nice with SQL 2005 given the nature of schemas in the newer version.</p>

<p>We're at the point now that we're ready to update our environment. We're writing .NET 3.5 apps to leverage more AJAX and SQL Server 2005 is the primary environment for our database. We're looking to update the security model as well to be a bit more flexible for the application administrators, and potentially leverage Active Directory more.</p>

<p>One concern we have as well is that a given user will most likely have access to multiple applications, so having some kind of centralized solution is optimal so we can easily remove users when needed.</p>

<p>What is considered the best practice for maintaining role security in this kind of environment?</p>

Not one response over there, which is pretty disappointing.  I also cannot figure out how to put a bounty on this question, but I would really, really love to get this issue solved.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have looked at many posts to see if this was posted before, and it was not.  Here's the short version:</p>

<p>I am going through the sample FB Connect tutorial (v1) and cannot make it work in IE8 on Win7.  It works as expected on FF3 on Win7.</p>

<p>Long Version:</p>

<p>I was suprised that things weren't working since I had pretty much copy and pasted over the content.  I skipped over the bit with the alert() javascript call, so I put that in to see if the parser was even getting to that.  I put the following code in:</p>

<pre><code>[my raw html]
Or use, &lt;fb:login-button length=""long"" onlogin=""alert('yo!!!');""&gt;&lt;/fb:login-button&gt;
[/my raw html]
</code></pre>

<p>The Alert is not popping on IE8.  It works on FF.</p>

<p>When I change back to calling the update_user_box(), my HTML looks like:</p>

<pre><code>Or use, &lt;fb:login-button length=""long"" onlogin=""update_user_box();""&gt;&lt;/fb:login-button&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    function update_user_box() {
        var user_box = document.getElementById(""user"");
        user_box.innerHTML =
            ""&lt;span&gt;""
            + ""&lt;fb:profile-pic uid='loggedinuser' facebook-logo='true'&gt;&lt;/fb:profile_pic&gt;""
            + ""Welcome, &lt;fb:name uid='loggedinuser' useyou='false'&gt;&lt;/fb:name&gt;.""
            + ""You are signed in.""
            + ""&lt;/span&gt;""

        FB.XFBML.Host.parseDomTree();
    }

    FB.init(""23e24c73feed7ca0f6afd876575842de"", ""../../Connect/xd_receiver.htm"", { ""ifUserConnected"": update_user_box });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this works in FF3 just fine.  My picture shows up and everything.  It actually makes me more upset that it worked in FF3 than a complete no work situation.</p>

<p>Here is the witnessed behavior in IE8:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When I click on the FBConnect button. the javascript window pops up and loads the right logon page</p></li>
<li><p>Focus changes back to the main window (the one with my app)</p></li>
<li><p>The main IE8 window (the one where I clicked the connect button) now shows a facebook logon page.</p></li>
<li><p>When I input my credentials into the FB javascript window, the page loads a blank doc

<p>5, If I close that window and type my credentials into the app window, the page reloads with the FBConnect button.</p>

<p>As I said, I am getting the expected behavior in FF3, but not IE8.  I even tried IE8's compatability mode, but that didn't work either.  Anyone have any clues as to what is happening?</p>

<p>My HTML tag looks like:</p>

<p>Now I am implementing Trac for my projects. Now the problem is what should I place as milestones and tickets. For tickets how granular should I get? e.g. should I say Make X part of Y feature or Make Y feature only. The more tickets I make, the more time I spend making these tickets.</p>

<p>Also, for milestones, I have seen projects like CakePHP etc. When they use Trac, they set their milestones as version numbers (corresponding to tags in the SVN). Is that the best way? </p>

<p>So say I have a client whose final deadline is X date. Then I set my milestone as 1.0 with deadline as X. But then how do I track the project say weekly? Cause I don't want to realise one day before the release date that that too much is left. I want to have somehow weekly checks. </p>

<p>Also I want to take into account enhancements/bugs also as tickets and club them together as milestones.</p>

<p>Sample usage:</p>

<pre><code>this.lblTimeDisplay.SafeInvoke(() =&gt; this.lblTimeDisplay.Text = this.task.Duration.ToString(), false);
</code></pre>

<p>I like how I can leverage closures to read, also, though forceSynchronous needs to be true in that case:</p>

<pre><code>string taskName = string.Empty;
this.txtTaskName.SafeInvoke(() =&gt; taskName = this.txtTaskName.Text, true);
</code></pre>

<p>I don't question the usefulness of this method for fixing up illegal calls in legacy code, but what about new code?  </p>

<p>Is it good design to use this method to update UI in a piece of new software when you may not know what thread is attempting to update the ui, or should new Winforms code generally contain a specific, dedicated method with the appropriate <code>Invoke()</code>-related plumbing for all such UI updates?  (I'll try to use the other appropriate background processing techniques first, of course, e.g. BackgroundWorker.)</p>

<p>Interestingly this won't work for <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.toolstripitem.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">ToolStripItems</a>.  I just recently discovered that they derive directly from <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.component.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Component</a> instead of from <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Control</a>.  Instead, the containing <code>ToolStrip</code>'s invoke should be used.</p>

<h2>Followup to comments:</h2>

<p>Some comments suggest that:</p>

<pre><code>if (uiElement.InvokeRequired)
</code></pre>

<p>should be:</p>

<pre><code>if (uiElement.InvokeRequired &amp;&amp; uiElement.IsHandleCreated)
</code></pre>

<p>Consider the following <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.invokerequired.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">msdn documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This means that InvokeRequired can
  <strong>return false</strong> if Invoke is not required
  (the call occurs on the same thread),
  or <strong>if the control was created on a
  different thread but the control's
  handle has not yet been created.</strong></p>
  
  <p>In the case where the control's handle
  has not yet been created, you should
  not simply call properties, methods,
  or events on the control. This might
  cause the control's handle to be
  created on the background thread,
  isolating the control on a thread
  without a message pump and making the
  application unstable.</p>
  
  <p><strong>You can protect against this case by
  also checking the value of
  IsHandleCreated when InvokeRequired
  returns false on a background thread.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the control was created on a different thread but the control's handle has not yet been created, <code>InvokeRequired</code> returns false.  This means that if <code>InvokeRequired</code> returns <code>true</code>, <code>IsHandleCreated</code> will always be true.  Testing it again is redundant and incorrect.</p>

<p>For an embedded system which does not use virtual addressing, I have an executable file that was compiled from C or C++ code with debugging information included. It's usually in COFF or ELF/DWARF (I get those two mixed up) format.</p>

<p>At runtime, on a PC, I would like to determine the address of a variable given its name. (e.g. ""foo.bar[7].baz"") This allows me to read/write the variable's value on the embedded system (given a debugging protocol that is beyond the scope of this question). Obviously, any variables that are stack-based or heap-based are out since they don't have static addresses.</p>

<p>I've done this before myself in C++ to parse COFF files from TI's compiler for their 2800 series DSPs, and it was kind of a pain. I was wondering if there was a Java library out there that does this sort of thing already, since I'm facing the same thing with one or two other processors' executable files.</p>

I'm trying to execute a command line statement on a windows box for my PHP web app.  It's running on windows XP, IIS5.1.

<pre><code>$cmd = ($config-&gt;svn."" cat "".$this-&gt;repConfig-&gt;svnParams().quote($path).' -r '.$rev.' &gt; '.quote($filename));

<p>This command does not work as is above, when it generates the following string:</p>

<p>If I copy/paste this to my own command line, it works fine.</p>

<p>If I hard code that very same path instead of adding it with the variable, it works!  I've tried with and without quotes around the file name.  I've tried with and without quotes around the entire command.  I've tried other directories.  I've tried passing an output paramter to exec(), and it comes back empty (Array () ).  I've tried redirecting the output of the error stream of the command to a file, and that error output file never gets created. </p>

<p>The only thing I can possibly concieve of is that exec() is failing silently.  What on earth am I doing wrong here?  If I hard code the file path, using the same dir structure and filename, it works fine.  If I don't, it doesn't.</p>

<p>Maybe the slashes () in the file path aren't being escaped properly, but when I do it manually with single quotes they are not considered escape sequences??</p>

<p><em>UPDATE:</em></p>

<p>I took the @ off of exec, and still not seeing any errors.</p>

<p>I gave the full path to SVN, still no luck.  It should be noted that the command worked fine before with the non-full path SVN so long as I manually specify the file destination for cat.</p>

<p><em>Update 2: RE: Kieth</em></p>

<p>I'm calling exec by trying both:</p>

<pre><code>exec($cmd);
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>exec($cmd, $out);
</code></pre>

<p>My php.ini already had safe_mode = 0.</p>

<p>I added error_reporting(E_ALL); and didn't see anything new</p>

<p>If I echo (or print_r) my exec call, I am not actually seing <em>anything</em></p>

<p>If I echo (or print_r) my exec call when included an output var, I get an empty arr</p>

<p><em>Update 3</em></p>

<p>I tried both escapeshellcmd and escapeshellarg to no avail (good idea though).</p>

<p>I should add that the file is being created through invoking</p>

<pre><code>tempnam(""temp"", ""wbsn"");
</code></pre>

<p>The fact that it works just fine if I manually specify the string instead of letting it be generated by tempname seems to suggests that the source of the problem, but I can't figure out how.  I did a comparison of the manual string with the one generated, and it came back as a match.</p>

The first time you hit TAB it focusses on the text field, and the second time it focuesses on the Browse button. This is invisible to JavaScript.</p>

<p>The problem is I want to use <a href=""http://valums.com/ajax-upload/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ajax Upload</a> or something similar to allow the user to click what looks like a button and see the File chooser appear. This works by placing an invisible file-input element under the mouse. I have managed to change the script to allow you to TAB to the hidden file-input element and for this to trigger a CSS change so the fake button looks like it has focus, the upshot being that, on browsers other than IE7, it looks to the user as if you can tab to the button and activate it as you would expect.</p>

<p>This cannot work on IE7 because the first TAB takes it to the invisible text field; pressing SPACE adds a space to the invisible file name instead of activating the file picker. I have tried adding an event handler for <code>keypress</code> that calls the <code>click</code> event, but when I do this the <code>change</code> event I am depending on seems not to be fired.</p>

<p>I am beginning to think the only accessible solution on IE7 (and, I assume, IE8) will be to replace the whole dialogue with a two part form -- the first part with a (visible) file-input element and Upload button, the second part with all the other form items. This is unfortunate because (a) IE7 get a less slick user experience, and (b) I have to add all sorts of extra server-side code to allow the form to be submitted in two parts. </p>

<p>So I would be interested to know if anyone has a way to make IE7's file-input element behave like a single control, or, alternatively, to allow JavaScript to access both controls of the element (something the DOM was not designed for!).</p>

These system calls come in very handy and are sometimes even necessary as your program <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_mode#Supervisor_mode"" rel=""noreferrer"">runs in user-space</a>.<br>
However system calls are rather expensive in terms of performance as they require an interrupt (and of course a system call) which means that a context switch must be made from your current active program in user-space to the system running in kernel-space.</p>

<p>The point I want to make is this: I'm currently implementing a compiler (for a university project) and one of the extra features I wanted to add is the support for multi-threaded code in order to enhance the performance of the compiled program. Because some of the multi-threaded code will be automatically generated by the compiler itself, this will almost guarantee that there will be really tiny bits of multi-threaded code in it as well. In order to gain a performance win, I must be sure that using threads will make this happen.</p>

<p>My fear however is that, in order to use threading, I <em>must</em> make system calls and the necessary interrupts. The tiny little (auto-generated) threads will therefore be highly affected by the time it takes to make these system calls, which could even lead to a performance loss...</p>

<p><strong>my question is therefore twofold (with an extra bonus question underneath it):</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Is it possible to write assembler
code which can run multiple threads
simultaneously on multiple cores at
once, <em>without</em> the need of system
calls?</li>
<li>Will I get a performance gain if I have really tiny threads (tiny as in the total execution time of the thread), performance loss, or isn't it worth the effort at all?</li>
</ul>

<p>My guess is that multithreaded assembler code is <em>not</em> possible without system calls. Even if this is the case, do you have a suggestion (or even better: some real code) for implementing threads as efficient as possible?</p>

<p>To forestall some expected suggestions: the Maven Release Plugin doesn't help me ... unless there's some magic way I can have my dependency versions not be SNAPSHOTs in the POMs but still let the developers work on more than one component at once?  </p>

<p><b>How should we manage the project and dependency versions in all of our our POMs?</b>  Right now it's just SNAPSHOTs everywhere, which makes things simple for the developers (they started with SNAPSHOTs and never concerned themselves with anything else).

So once and for all, tell me how to implement this example:</p>

<p>I have a list of upcoming events that needs to be displayed on several pages of my website. Therefore I have put a new ViewUserControl (ListEvents.ascx) inside my Views\Shared folder.</p>

<p>I am requesting this ListEvents.ascx to render on my Home/Index view like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
    Here's a list of events:
    &lt;% Html.RenderPartial(""ListEvents"");%&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How would I go about passing my model to this viewusercontrol? I know I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
    Here's a list of events:
    &lt;% Html.RenderPartial(""ListEvents"", (new Model.Services.EventService(null)).ListEvents());%&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But that doesn't seem like a very smart thing to do, creating a new model from inside a view?! Or am I wrong here? I can't even pass any validationstate, hence the null parameter.
So an alternative option is to store this data into the ViewData[] member, but my viewusercontrol is not supposed to be dependant on the ViewData of it's parent!</p>

<p>I'm sure there is a very simple answer to this, please share as I'm done browsing the web for this problem.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Simple Answer</strong>:
A viewusercontrol should always receive it's model from the View in which it resides. Working around this, like by adding a codebehind file to a viewusercontrol, would break the MVC pattern.</p>

When I query both tables with a select statement, ordered by a datetime field of the postings table, MySQL always uses filesort, resulting in very slow query times (>1 second). Here's the schema of the <code>postings</code> table (simplified):</p>

<pre><code>+---------------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field               | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+---------------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id                  | int(11)      | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| feed_id             | int(11)      | NO   | MUL | NULL    |                |
| crawl_date          | datetime     | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| is_active           | tinyint(1)   | NO   | MUL | 0       |                |
| link                | varchar(255) | NO   | MUL | NULL    |                |
| author              | varchar(255) | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| title               | varchar(255) | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| excerpt             | text         | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| long_excerpt        | text         | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| user_offtopic_count | int(11)      | NO   | MUL | 0       |                |
+---------------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the <code>feed</code> table:</p>

<pre><code>+-------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field       | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id          | int(11)      | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| type        | int(11)      | NO   | MUL | 0       |                |
| title       | varchar(255) | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| website     | varchar(255) | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| url         | varchar(255) | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the query that takes >1 second to execute. Please note that the <code>post_date</code> field has an index, but MySQL isn't using it to sort the postings table:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    `postings`.`id`, 
    UNIX_TIMESTAMP(postings.post_date) as post_date, 
    `postings`.`link`, 
    `postings`.`title`, 
    `postings`.`author`, 
    `postings`.`excerpt`, 
    `postings`.`long_excerpt`, 
    `feeds`.`title` AS feed_title, 
    `feeds`.`website` AS feed_website
FROM 
    (`postings`)
JOIN 
    `feeds` 
ON 
    `feeds`.`id` = `postings`.`feed_id`
WHERE 
    `feeds`.`type` = 1 AND 
    `postings`.`user_offtopic_count` &lt; 10 AND 
    `postings`.`is_active` = 1
ORDER BY 
    `postings`.`post_date` desc
LIMIT 
    15  
</code></pre>

<p>The result of the <code>explain extended</code> command on this query shows that MySQL is using filesort:</p>

<pre><code>+----+-------------+----------+--------+---------------------------------------+-----------+---------+--------------------------+-------+-----------------------------+
| id | select_type | table    | type   | possible_keys                         | key       | key_len | ref                      | rows  | Extra                       |

|  1 | SIMPLE      | feeds    | eq_ref | PRIMARY,type                          | PRIMARY   | 4       | feedian.postings.feed_id |     1 | Using where                 |
+----+-------------+----------+--------+---------------------------------------+-----------+---------+--------------------------+-------+-----------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>When I remove the <code>order by</code> part, MySQL stops using filesort. Please let me know if you have any ideas on how to optimize this query to get MySQL to sort and select the data by using indexes. I have already tried a few things such as creating a combined index on all where/order by fields, as suggested by a few blog postings, but this didn't work either.</p>

My current position is at a company that uses exclusively VB.NET development for .NET applications.  I have worked with C# in college and some on my own after college and that is what I want to use for my career in the future.  </p>

<p>I have the first O'Reilly Programming C# book for VS.NET 1.0 by Jesse Liberty from a college course.  I remember this book being really helpful to me in college and I don't want to spend another $40+ dollars on a book. </p>

<p>So my question is how out-of-date is the first section of that book: ""The C# language"" (chapters 1 through 12) and even some of the later sections of the book?  Has the language changed so much that it would be better to not read this book and use some other online sources?  I have some new ASP.NET 3.5 books that should take care of the stuff that has changed for web applications, but I mainly want to get refreshed on the C# language.</p>

<p><strong>Just to Clarify:</strong>
This is a great website I just refreshed a few minutes later and had several great responses from other professionals!<br>
Unfortunately I've been doing primarily support at my current position rather than new development so I'm not extremely familiar with all the new .NET classes.  Majority of time is spent debugging/enhancing legacy apps (C++, VB6, with VB.NET applications)  This is why I'm applying for a junior level posision and would be willing to take a slight paycut just to be able to do new development with guidance from a good lead developer.  I think that would be a lot better for my future career goals.</p>

<p>I've been tasked to port/convert/upgrade a site at work from table based layout to CSS based layout.  The site is very typical, it has a header, navigation bar (width of header), left column, main column, followed by a footer.</p>

<p>One problem is our corporate web standard is IE6.  We are rumored to deploy IE7 soon, but currently, IE6 is my target.  I use Firefox, but my users don't, so it won't help.</p>

I have to write/generate markup that will work with IE6, and hopefully will also work with IE7 and IE8, but IE6 is my base line.</p>

<p>Are there tools out there which can help me, or get me part of the way there?  I just need a tool that can generate me some layout, like the Calendar Wizard in Word.</p>

<p>I know it's a tall order, any suggestions?</p>

<p>Under appropriate uses for sqlite it has:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Situations Where SQLite Works Well</p>
  
  <p>•Websites</p>
  
  <p>SQLite usually will work great as the
  database engine for low to medium
  traffic websites (which is to say,
  99.9% of all websites). The amount of web traffic that SQLite can handle
  depends, of course, on how heavily the
  website uses its database. Generally
  speaking, any site that gets fewer
  than 100K hits/day should work fine
  with SQLite. The 100K hits/day figure
  is a conservative estimate, not a hard
  upper bound. SQLite has been
  demonstrated to work with 10 times
  that amount of traffic.</p>
  
  <p>Situations Where Another RDBMS May
  Work Better</p>
  
  <p>•Client/Server Applications</p>
  
  <p>If you have many client programs
  accessing a common database over a
  network, you should consider using a
  client/server database engine instead
  of SQLite. SQLite will work over a
  network filesystem, but because of the
  latency associated with most network
  filesystems, performance will not be
  great. Also, the file locking logic of
  many network filesystems
  implementation contains bugs (on both
  Unix and Windows). If file locking
  does not work like it should, it might
  be possible for two or more client
  programs to modify the same part of
  the same database at the same time,
  resulting in database corruption.
  Because this problem results from bugs
  in the underlying filesystem
  implementation, there is nothing
  SQLite can do to prevent it.</p>
  
  <p>A good rule of thumb is that you
  should avoid using SQLite in
  situations where the same database
  will be accessed simultaneously from
  many computers over a network
  filesystem.</p>

So if it's halfway from circle to shuriken and I remove my mouse from the area, it should remain in that halfway form, not jump back to being a circle.</p>

<p>Second, I need to be able to drag the shape, and while dragging it, the shape tween must behave like it would normally. Releasing it doesn't make it stop ""tweening"", only moving my mouse out if its area. The gradient background gives the nice effect of the colors constantly changing.</p>

<p>I've named the shape-tween ""circle_mc"".</p>

<p>What I can't implement:<br />
1) The shape reacting to my mouseover<br />
2) Making the shape dragable.</p>

<p>Can someone give me some hints, perhaps articles or examples on this?</p>

<p>I'm new to Objective-C, and Cocoa. In fact, I'm completely new to C in general. I'm trying to implement an iPhone game using <a href=""http://www.sapusmedia.com/cocos2d-iphone-api-doc/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cocos2d-iPhone</a>. It's a game I've made before in Flash, so I thought it would be a nice way to lean Objective C, cocoa and cocos2d. </p>

<p>One thing I am having a big problem with is understanding why all the <a href=""http://wiki.slembcke.net/main/published/Chipmunk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chipmunk</a> code looks different to all the normal Objective-C stuff. For example, there's stuff like</p>

<pre><code>chipmunkBody-&gt;position.x
</code></pre>

<p>which I thought would have been</p>

<p><code>chipmunkBody.position.x</code> or maybe <code>[[chipmunkBody position] x]</code> (bad example maybe). </p>

<p>One way this keeps on biting me in the ass is with cpVect. cpVect is pretty important, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to pass it around. CGPoint, no problem, I can make pointers, pass them around in methods and what not, but the second I use cpVect instead, it's ""welcome to Errorville, population you"".</p>

<p>So that's the question, what is Chipmunk, so I can start finding out more about working with it. </p>

Would really appreciate any help.  Spent the last week trying to make heads or tails out of it.  I apologize if this problem has been posted before.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The information for each product (including photo) is stored in a database.<br>
Depending on the action of the user on the span (<em>i.e. prodInfo</em>), the desired process is:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>hover</strong> will display a small popup with some product info and some details (e.g. price).</li>
<li><strong>click</strong> will show (animate) a semi-transparent overlay and a &lt;div id=""frame""&gt; containing all information regarding the product, including the photo.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have an image inside the frame that when clicked, would hide the overlay/frame.<br>
Information (including photo) is pulled using jQuery Ajax <code>$.get()</code>.<br>
Using jQuery, I was able to achieve this on the first pass (the first <strong>click</strong>).  However, after I close ""frame"" and hide the overlay, and then <strong>hover</strong> over any ""prodInfo,"" it'll display the small popup as it should be but at the same time ALSO DISPLAYS the overlay and the ""frame"" as if I invoked a <strong>click</strong>.  </p>

<p>Here is the simplified jQuery code for the two events:</p>

<pre><code>$("".prodInfo"").mouseover(
  function(e) {   // function fired when 'moused over'
    var popupItem = $(""#div_infoPopupItem"");  // absolute positioned popup
    var prod = $(this).attr('id');
    var prd;

    popupInit(popupItem, e); // changes the top/left coords

    $.ajax({            
      type    : 'GET',
      url     : 'prodInfo.aspx',
      data    : 'id=' + prod,
      success :

        function(prodInfo, status) {
          var prodStr = '&lt;b&gt;No product name.&lt;/b&gt;';

          prd = prodInfo.split('::');  // product info delimited by '::'
          prodStr = '&lt;div class=""popupInfo_head""&gt;' + prd[0] + '&lt;/div&gt;' +
                    '&lt;div style=""margin:2px;""&gt;' + prd[1] + '&lt;/div&gt;';
                    // and so on...

          popupItem.html(prodStr);
          return false;
        },
    error :
      function() {
        popupItem.html('Error in collecting information.');
      }
    });

    popupItem.animate({ opacity : .94 }, { queue:false, duration: 120 });
    return false;
  }
);

$("".prodInfo"").click(
  function(e) {
    var prod    = $(this).attr('id');
    var frame   = $(""#div_frame"");
    var overlay = $(""#div_overlay"");
    var info;
    var img     = new Image();

    document.getElementById('div_frame').scrollTop = 0;
    $.get('prodInfo.aspx', { id: prod },
      function (result) {
        info = result.split(';;');     // name ;; status ;; description ;; price, etc.

        $(this).ajaxSuccess(
          function (e, request, settings) {

<p>Below is the event definition of the ""close"" image located inside the frame.</p>

<pre><code>$(""#img_close"").click(
  function (e) {
    $(""#div_frame"")
      .animate({ opacity: 0}, 100, '', 
        function() {
          $(""#div_overlay"")
            .animate({ top   : ""50%"" }, { queue: false, duration: 120 })
            .animate({ height: ""0px"" }, 120);
        }
      );

      return false;
  }
);
</code></pre>

<p>As mentioned, this will work as planned only before the first click.  After I click on a <em>prodInfo</em> <code>span</code> and close the frame/overlay, the next mouseover on a <em>prodInfo</em> actually invokes BOTH mouseover and ALSO a click (which shows back the overlay/frame).</p>

<p>When I was working with installers, we would just change the build numbering in our build system to mark a build as a test or release candidate instead of a development snapshot, and tell people to install only the candidate build for testing.  The problem with doing that with RPMs is that if we change the numbering system, we'll break the delivery mechanism and installed machines won't be able to tell which is the latest version of the RPM any more.</p>

<p>The best way I've thought of to get around this is to put the candidate RPMs in a completely separate RPM repository, but this also gets complicated because we have multiple RPMs coming from the same repository that are on different release cycles, so we'll be trying to pull the release candidate version of RPM A from the new repository while still wanting to get development snapshots of RPM B from the development repository.</p>

I'm trying to implement a GUI widget in swing that allows files to be dropped onto a JTable, and allows the rows of the JTable to be dragged for re-sorting. Think VLC's playlists or the one in iTunes.</p>

<p>I got dropping files from the OS (Explorer, Finder, etc.) working just fine, but I'm having an impossible time with re-arranging the rows of the table, once the files are in. The problem is that when I add a custom TransferHandler to the table, dragging <em>from</em> the table is instantly killed. Here is some example code:</p>

<pre><code>import javax.swing.*;

public class TableTest
{
    public static void main (String [] argv)
    {
        // setup table data
        String [] columns = new String [] {""Foo"", ""Bar"", ""Baz"", ""Quux""};
        String [][] data = new String [][] {{""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D""},
                        {""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4""},
                        {""i"", ""ii"", ""iii"", ""iv""}};
        // create table
        JTable table = new JTable(data, columns);

        // set up drag and drop
        table.setDragEnabled(true);
        table.setDropMode(DropMode.INSERT_ROWS);
        table.setFillsViewportHeight(true);
        TransferHandler dnd = new TransferHandler() {
            // here be code to handle drops, and one would
            // presume drag exporting, too
        };
        table.setTransferHandler(dnd);
        JScrollPane scroll = new JScrollPane(table);

        // create and show window
        JFrame window = new JFrame();
        window.getContentPane().add(scroll);
        window.pack();
        window.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        window.setVisible(true);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Run this code as-is and you'll see that you cannot initiate a drag on the table.If you comment out the call to setTransferHandler() on the table, dragging works (i.e., when I start dragging a table row, I get the X'd out circle cursor saying I can't drop there). But as soon as a TransferHandler is set for the table, I can't drag any rows. The problem has to be in the TransferHandler, but I've thoroughly troubleshot and debugged it, and have determined that dragging is never started once there is a TransferHandler on the table. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>I have created the following very simple class in the file MyClass.cs:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass
{
    private string myName;

    public string MyName
    {
        get
        {

        }
    }

    public MyClass()
    {
        myName = ""Allen"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also created a simple form with 1 textbox and 1 button. I init'd one instance of Myclass inside the form code and built the project. Using the DataSource Wizard in Vs2008, I selected to create a data source based on object, and selected the MyClass assembly. This created a datasource entity. I changed the databinding of the textbox to this datasource; however, the expected result (that the textbox's contents would be ""allen"") was not achieved. Further, putting text into the textbox is not updating the name property of the object.</p>

<p>I know i'm missing something fundamental here.  At some point i should have to tie my instance of the MyClass class that i initialized inside the form code to the textbox, but that hasn't occurred.  Everything i've looked at online seems to gloss over using DataBinding with an object (or i'm missing the mark entirely), so any help is great appreciated. </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Utilizing what I learned by the answers, I looked at the code generated by Visual Studio, it had the following:</p>

<pre><code>this.myClassBindingSource.DataSource = typeof(BindingTest.MyClass);
</code></pre>

<p>if I comment that out and substitute: </p>

<pre><code>this.myClassBindingSource.DataSource = new MyClass();
</code></pre>

<p>I get the expected behavior. Why is the default code generated by VS like it is?  Assuming this is more correct than the method that works, how should I modify my code to work within the bounds of what VS generated? </p>

<p>My next question is when I <em>DO</em> change funcB to ""funcB() throws IndexOutOfBoundsException"" how come funcA doesn't need to catch funcB's thrown exception?  Does the compiler dig deep and realize that ByteBuffer.wrap(...) isn't declared as ""wrap() throws IndexOutOfBoundsException"" so all callers don't actually need to catch anything even sub-callers (funcB in this case) actually are declared as ""funcB throws IndexOutOfBoundsException""?</p>

The plan is to add each cpp file that I want to test to the Tests project. The Tests project has access to all header files from Main.</p>

<p>I have added one cpp file to the Tests project, and it compiles, but comes up with linker errors. Most are because of a class derived from COleDateTime, called CTimeValue. The unit under test has methods with pass-by-value CTimeValue parameters and also declares some CTimeValue attributes.</p>

<p>I know that I can write my own tag but am curious if there's an existing solution for this.</p>

The bucket can either be a new one (one that has never been used before, of which there are an infinite supply) or it can be an existing bucket. If I look at the number of buckets with one item, the number with two, the number with three, etc., I want those bucket counts to follow an exponential distribution. I hope I'm saying that correctly -- if 80% of the buckets have 1 item, then 16% should have two, 3.2% should have three, etc. In general, the number of buckets of size k should be 1/p as many as the number of buckets of size k-1, and the fraction of buckets that are size 1 should be (1-p) to make the math work out right.</p>

<p>If I knew the number of items in advance, it would be easy: I'd know how many buckets of each size, so I can just pile the the items into as many buckets of each size as I needed. Or if I were just generating bucket sizes, it'd be easy even if I didn't know the total in advance: each new bucket has probability (1-p) of being size 1, (1-p)p of being size 2, (1-p)p^2 size 3, (1-p)p^3 size 4, etc.</p>

<p>But I am processing <em>items</em>, so as I get an item in, I need to choose a bucket: either an existing one, or a new one. If I make a new bucket, then I get one more of size 1. But if I choose an existing one of size k, then I get one more bucket of size k+1, and one <strong>fewer</strong> of size k. So what should the probability of choosing a bucket of size k be (where k can be zero to indicate making a new bucket)? And how does it relate to p?</p>

<p>I am doing this to generate test data where I only know the mean number of items per bucket (1.5, it turns out), don't know the number of items in advance, and think that the exponential distribution of bucket sizes is realistic for my situation. I'm probably making it more complicated than it needs to be, but I was surprised because I thought it would be easy.</p>

<p>And maybe it is, but I'm just missing something. (And I can't figure out how to Google it, either.)</p>

<p>The standard solution to this problem is to keep a history table for each data table,
and whenever a row needs to be updated in the data table, a copy of the current row gets inserted to the history table and than the row in the data table gets updated.</p>

<p>the disadvantages of this solution for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>maintenance of 2 tables instead of 1, (in case the structure of the table needs change)</li>
<li>the application needs to know both of the tables instead of one</li>
<li>names of the tables might need to be short to keep a convention of the table name and the history table name (SOME_TABLE, SOME_TABLE_HIST for example)</li>
</ul>

<p>I am considering a different solution and would like to know if it's ok.
for each table, we add the column IS_LAST</p>

<ul>
<li>when a row gets inserted to the table, it will get inserted with IS_LAST=1.</li>
<li>when a row gets updated, a copy of the original row will be duplicated to the same table with the change of IS_LAST=0, and the original row will get updated as needed (still keeping IS_LAST=1).</li>
</ul>

<p>assume that in my case, rows are updated at an average of 10 times.
also assume that at least 90% of the actions performed by the application happens only on the recent version of the rows. </p>

<p>my database is an Oracle 10g so to keep the ""active"" table slim, we can split the table to 2 partitions: the IS_LAST=1 partition, and the IS_LAST=0 partition.</p>

<p>Is partitioning a good way of solving the history data keeping problem?</p>

<p>Does this solution limits other partition potential to these tables?</p>

<p>We found 2 ways to translate the text.
 1. use JSON inside our text input
Why this solution is bad. Every text input will need to be bigger because we can't guess the real size of the attribute.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>Use the a translating table that keep reference to the original model and translate every field. It will still need big field because we cant define the field size by record.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the best solution I came with is creating a translating table. The table will keep foreign key of other tables. For each translation, we copy the record that need to be translated. Inside the translation table, there is 4 field, model_name(primary), reference_id(primary), translated_id(primary), locale(primary). This solution make it impossible to have multiple translation for the same model in the same language.</p></li>
<li><p>Last but not least, we could use something like someone proposed...a database gettext. We have a table that contain strings and only string (key, text, locale) so we can search for a model, a string that is the same as the one used in the model and then use the we found instead.</p></li>

One of the simplest most basic things he talks about is that methods should be small, he goes all the way as to say that they should not contain more than three lines.</p>

<p>Considering that I broke down a recursive method into two smaller ones but in a code review one of my peers suggested that it looked weird and that recursion was kind of hidden.</p>

<p>So, what is your opinion on that? I'm including both approaches below.</p>

<p>This is the one method approach.</p>

<pre><code>private object GetObject(string propertyName, object dataObject)
{
  object returnObject;

  if (dataObject == null) return null;

  if (propertyName.Contains("".""))
  {
    Type dataObjectType = dataObject.GetType();
    PropertyInfo dataObjectProperty = dataObjectType.GetProperty(propertyName.Substring(0, propertyName.IndexOf(""."")));

    ThrowExceptionIfObjectOrPropertyInexistant(dataObjectProperty, dataObjectType.FullName, propertyName);

    object nestedObject = dataObjectProperty.GetValue(dataObject, null);
    string nestedObjectPropertyName = propertyName.Substring(propertyName.IndexOf(""."") + 1);

    returnObject = GetObject(nestedObjectPropertyName, nestedObject);
  }
  else
  {
    returnObject = dataObject;
  }

  return returnObject;

  else

    returnObject = dataObject;
  }

  return returnObject;

There are many tools to statically and dynamically analyze code.  What sort of mathematical formula would allow me to integrate the amount of activity in a file along with the number of deployments of that software?  We are finding that even if a program completes all of its unit tests, it requires more work than we would expect at upgrade time.  A measure of this type should be possible, but sitting down and thinking about even its units has me stumped.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> If something gets sent to a test machine I could see marking it less rotten.  If something gets sent to all test boxes I could see it getting a fresh marker.  If something goes to production I could give it a nod and reduce its <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bitrot</a> score.

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  I think dimensional analysis could probably just be based on age.  Relative to that is a little more difficult.  Old code is rotten.  The average age of each line of code still is simply a measure of time.  Does a larger source module rot faster than a smaller, more complex one?  </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> Code coverage is measured in lines.  Code executed often must by definition be less rotten than code never executed.  To accurately measure bitrot you would need coverage analysis to act as a damper.</p>

However after reading through I am not sure if this model is really open.</p>

<p>The way I understand is that they open up the source and contributors, depending on how much the contribute get badges (like at stackoverflow) and are compensated accordingly from the company's revenue stream. Here are the steps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1st step: Releasing the source</p>
  
  <p>The source will be made a available,
  so that users can study and modify the
  application for their own needs. If
  they want to contribute their changes
  back, they can submit them for review.
  To discourage piracy, a tiny but
  essential core (also containing the
  licensing code), will be kept private
  (at least until users reach a certain
  rating). This will gradually be
  followed by a similar opening of the
  rest of the company (web site,
  documentation, bug tracking, etc..)</p>
  
  <p>2nd step: Building the Trust Metric</p>
  
  <p>The basic infrastructure will be set
  up so that participants can start
  rating each other. The algorithms and
  code will be released as open source,
  so that they can be studied and
  discussed (and used by others). It
  will probably need quite some time and
  tweaking before we reach a fair
  balance.</p>
  
  <p>3rd step: Compensating Participants</p>
  
  <p>All income in the company (minus
  operating expenses), will be passed
  through the trust metric and
  distributed to participants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The company still keeps some bits private to retain control and that doesn't make it truly open. How is that any different from hiring developers and compensating them with stock options and merit-based bonuses?</p>

<p>EDIT: David Brown points out the <a href=""http://e-texteditor.com/blog/2009/releasing-the-source"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">developer response</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the addition of the extra clause
  means that the license can no longer be
  termed an Open Source License, it is
  ideal for the open company. It is
  essentially an issue of mutual respect.
  If I fully respect your ownership, you
  will in return respect my right to make
  a living.</p>

I'm clear with the very basic task of how to create a proxy and basic filters and stuff. But what I cannot understand is how to manually force-serve a file through cache. </p>

<p>Basically, the scenario is this that I run this proxy in computer A. The user on computer B accesses web uses this proxy. Now, this proxy will just act as a pass through for all B's requests, until he requests a particular URL (a file, say <a href=""http://abc.com/file.zip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://abc.com/file.zip</a>). I need to intercept this request, and instead of allowing him to download the actual file.zip, give him an already downloaded file that I manually kept on computer A.</p>

<p>Also, note that I might not have a web server running on computer A, so I can't just redirect the url, I need to serve it from cache.</p>

<p>Any pointers for this would be appreciated.
Thanks</p>

<p>Edit: Some more info. I started using HTTP::Daemon and LWP::UserAgent in combination instead of HTTP::Proxy
So far, I intercept all requests successfully, and then I search the headers for the url. If the particular filename is not there, I just pass the request to actual destination using LWP:UserAgent (simple_request) and return the response to original sender using send_response. If I find the filename, I don't further forward the request, instead I'm trying to serve my particular file using ""send_file_response"" method. The problem is that all other requests  are working fine and comp B is able to surf the net, but when it tries to download this file, it just keeps waiting for a response.

The ANI lookup table has 2 significant columns, StoreID and PhoneNumber.  The PhoneNumber column is the (unique) Primary key, as there must be only one StoreID returned for a given PhoneNumber.</p>

<li>Branch store AltPhone  </li>

<li>Branch store contact phone  

<ul>
<li>If a phone number already exists in the destination table, do not add it...</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>So the resulting dataset should be:  </p>

<pre><code>StoreID  Phone  
1        402-123-2300  (first pass)  
2        202-321-7800  
1        402-123-2345  (2nd pass)  
2        202-321-7890  
3        202-302-5600  (3rd &amp; 4th pass - only add once)  
1        402-123-2346  (5th pass - skip dup)  
1        402-321-3213  
2        202-231-7893  (do not add dups)  
3        402-123-2356  (final pass - skip dup)

<p>My approach to prioritizing which phone number of the duplicates to choose is to make multiple queries based on other criteria (main store vs branch, for example), inserting the first entry found into the ANI lookup table and skipping subsequent duplicates.  </p>

<p>How do I do this without using RBAR?  I have tried the following with no luck - actually, it works OK until I get to the Store_Contacts table, where there can be multiple identical phone numbers for a given store:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO dbo.Store_PhoneNumbers (StoreID, PhoneNumber)
    SELECT DISTINCT StoreID, dbo.GetPhoneNumber10(StorePhone)
    FROM dbo.Store_Info
    WHERE dbo.IsAniNumber(dbo.GetPhoneNumber10(StorePhone)) = 1
        AND ParentID = 0
        AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM dbo.Store_PhoneNumbers WHERE PhoneNumber = dbo.GetPhonenumber10(StorePhone));
</code></pre>

<p>... repeat for AltPhone, then StorePhone where ParentID &lt;> 0 then AltPhone w/ ParentID &lt;> 0</p>

<p>So far so good, then here's where it falls apart:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO dbo.Store_PhoneNumbers (StoreID, PhoneNumber)
    SELECT DISTINCT sc.StoreID, dbo.GetPhoneNumber10(sc.Phone)
    FROM Store_Contacts sc
            INNER JOIN
        Store_Info si ON sc.StoreID = si.StoreID
    WHERE (dbo.IsAniNumber(dbo.GetPhoneNumber10(sc.Phone)) = 1)
        AND (si.ParentID = 0)

<p>Imagine something like the widget that Audacity uses to display an audio track. It's a horizontal timeline, with a ruler. It is possible to zoom in and out, and to scroll, and the ruler updates to reflect where / how deep you are on the timeline.
Only a finite segment of the timeline is ""occupied"", i.e., actually contains data. The rest is empty.
It is possible to select with the mouse any time point on the timeline, and, of course, it is possible to let it ""play"": to traverse the timeline from left to right in a specified speed.</p>

<p>If you know something that's at least close to what I describe, I'd be interested.</p>

<p>If you want to know what the job of this widget is: It's for a program for running simulations. The program calculates the simulation in the background, extending the ""occupied"" part of the timeline. It is possible to select different points in the timeline to observe the state of the system in a certain timepoint, and of course it is possible to play the simulation.</p>

The applications that will eventually use the library are not Spring-based, however, nor does it use any IoC/DI container of any sort currently.  My question is, what's the best approach for injecting dependencies if Spring or Guice are not used?  Should I consider something like a factory method to instantiate and wire the objects?  The dependencies are all inside the library, so it doesn't seem appropriate to have the application instantiate each dependency to create the main object.  </p>

I've got a two different window hooks, one's a global hook of the WH_SHELL variety that watches for new top-level windows, the second's a thread hook of the WH_CALLWNDPROC which is set on some of the top-level windows discovered by the first hook.  The two hooks are implemented in different DLLs.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, both hooks are being installed properly.  However, nothing I Post to the hooks windows with <strike>a message code > WM_USER</strike> a register message is ever handled by the custom WH_CALLWNDPROC hook, but ""normal"" windows messages are passing thought it just fine.</p>

<p>Code that hooks a discovered window:</p>

<pre><code>... Getting handle, mod, and procHook ...
DWORD threadId = GetWindowThreadProcessId(handle, NULL);

HHOOK hook = SetWindowsHookEx(WH_CALLWNDPROC, (HOOKPROC)procHook, mod, threadId);

if(!PostMessage(handle, CUSTOM_MESSAGE, NULL, NULL))
{
  ... fetch and print error message ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The body of the hook itself:</p>

<pre><code>... Report sends a message to an agreed upon window with the passed wParam &amp; lParam
Report(20, nCode);

if(nCode == CUSTOM_MESSAGE)
{
  ... This code is never reached ...
  Report(50, ERROR_SUCCESS);

  if(PerformTask())
    Report(200, ERROR_SUCCESS);
  else
    Report(400, ERROR_SUCCESS);
}

... More code handling more messages in the same basic form
</code></pre>

<p>The first Report call is what's confirmed that the hook is installed and working, as it posts back a bunch of messages in the low teens and twenties (ERASEBACKGROUND, PAINT, etc.).</p>

<p><strike>CUSTOM_MESSAGE is defined as WM_USER + 314.  The message used for Report(...) is WM_USER + 317.</strike></p>

<p><em>I have since updated my code to use RegisterWindowMessage to obtain a UINT to send, it was incorrect of me to use WM_USER for inter-process communication.</em></p>

<p>So, basically, what is wrong with either my design or my usage of windows hooks and PostMessage?  If I've omitted any details, let me know; there's alot of code involved and this is a pretty large question already, so I've tried to only include what I think is relevant.</p>

<p>As an aside, is there an agreed upon better way to debug hooks?  I've been using the moral equivalent to cout &lt;&lt; ... everything by posting messages to an agreed upon window and debugging its WndProc.</p>

"716101","1","","","2009-04-03 23:39:33","","0","1090","<p>A little background -- we're designing an application that uses a client/server architecture consisting of:</p>

<ul>
<li>A server which loads server-side modules, potentially developed by other teams.</li>
<li>A client which loads corresponding client-side modules (also potentially developed by those other teams; each client module corresponds with a server module).</li>
<li>The client side communicates with the server side for general coordination, and as well as module specific tasks. (At this point, I think that means client talks to server, client modules talk to server modules.)</li>
<li>Environment is .NET 3.5, and client side is WPF.</li>
</ul>

<p>The deployment scenario introduces the potential to upgrade the server, any server-side module, the client, and any client-side module independently. However, being able to ""work"" using mismatched versions is required. I'm therefore concerned about versioning issues.</p>

<p>My thinking so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Windows Service for the server.</li>
<li>Using System.AddIn for the server to load and communicate with the server modules will give us the greatest flexibility in terms of version compatability between server and server modules.</li>
<li>The server and each server module vend WCF services for communication to the client side; communication between the server and a server module, or between two server modules use the AddIn contracts. (One advantage of this is that a module can expose a different interface within the server and outside it.)</li>
<li>Similarly, the client uses System.AddIn to find, load, and communicate with the client modules. </li>
<li>Client communications with client modules is via the AddIn interface; communications from the client and from client modules to the server side are via WCF.</li>
<li>For maximum resilience, each module will run in a separate app-domain.</li>
<li>In general, the system has modest performance requirements, so marshalling and crossing process boundaries is not expected to be a performance concern. (Performance requirement is basically summed up by: don't get in the way of the other parts of the system not described here.) </li>
</ul>

<p>My questions are around the idea of having two different communication and versioning models to work with which will be an added burden on our developers. System.AddIn seems quite powerful, but also a little unwieldly. (I'm also unsure of Microsoft's commitment to it in the future.) On the other hand, I'm not thrilled with WCF's versioning capabilities. I have a feeling that it would be possible to implement the System.AddIn view/adapter/contract system within WCF, but being fairly new to both technologies, I would have no idea of where to start.</p>

For recent Intel x86 processors (e.g. Q9300), it is very hard to find detailed information about cache structure.  In particular, most web sites (including <a href=""http://www.intel.com/products/processor/core2quad/specifications.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Intel.com</a>) that post processor specs do not include any reference to L1 cache.  Is this because the L1 cache does not exist or is this information for some reason considered unimportant?  Are there any articles or discussions about the elimination of the L1 cache?</p>

<p>[edit]
After running various tests and diagnostic programs (mostly those discussed in the answers below), I have concluded that my Q9300 seems to have a 32K L1 data cache.  I still haven't found a clear explanation as to why this information is so difficult to come by.

<pre><code>var Graph = function() {

<p>I could separate each of the components in different classes, for example make a Legend class. But it seems silly to create a class for what's sometimes just 5-10 lines of code, and it would be uglier because I'd need to pass in a bunch of private state. And I wouldn't be able to test my helper functions. Should I do this anyway? Should I suck it up and only test the public draw()? Or is there some other solution?</p>

After the nant script completes, I have the compelte structure for our CD and also our download.</p>

<p>I was just doing a get from sourcesafe onto an unused desktop and using it as a build box, compiling there.  Sometimes we would have a couple of files checked in that fix something critical.  In those cases I would go to the build box, and very selectively get only those files, to avoid getting other changed files that we aren't ready to release yet.  Basically I am able to allow development to continue and selectively include certain changed files into the installer for release.</p>

<p>Now we no longer have a free box, and need to build from our server.  So I am setting up CI Factory so that the developer can kick the build off without remoting into the server.  The one issue I am struggling with, is the best way to continue to allow this selective change control to occur.  The default concept of CI that CI Factory implements is fine for internal development ""head"".  However, I also want to setup a CCNet project that is run only on demand via a Force Build for this ""public release"" type of build.</p>

<p>This is what I've brain stormed so far, without being sure how well this will work, if at all(still figuring out what CCNet and CI Factory are all about).  The ""public release"" CCNet project config/build would be setup such that it would <strong>not</strong> get latest.  Modifications would <strong>not</strong> trigger a build.  Since the other CCNet project that is using the default CI methodology(we'll call it the ""CI project"") of getting latest when changes are detected, then these two projects can't share the same working directory.  So the ""public release"" would need a different working copy, so that its files won't get updated when the CI project's build is triggered.  The developer would need to remote into the server, one VSS, selectively do a get into the ""public release""'s working copy, and then force a build through CI Factory.</p>

<p>The disadvantage's I see with this is<br>
1) Having to remote in to selectively do gets.<br>
2) I have no idea how to allow a single CI Factory project to have two different working copies of the Product folder, so that each project configuration block has it's own.<br>
3) I'm afraid of what kind of strangeness this might cause.  I'm not quite sure yet how to specify a source control block in CCNet project config block, but prevent it from doing a get latest when it builds.  I'm still gradually figuring out what things are in scripts and can be easily taken out without breaking other things, versus what is not meant to be mucked around with and/or is not configurable.  </p>

<p>I would really like to hear about how others deal with this issue of selectively releasing changes, if you have a similar situation.  I am constrained to VSS, so my immediate need is to solve this with that in mind, but at the same time I'd be interested in hearing how you manage this with other source control systems.  I guess you would probably have a branch that is your latest developments branch, and then merge changes into the trunk whenever you want to release them?  I really don't trust VSS for branching/merging, and I think the branching concepts might be a little too much overhead and learning curve for this shop.  Like I said though, stories with other source control systems would be useful future knowledge for me.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

I'm not talking about the long-term maintenance of the code itself; rather, what guidelines do you use to keep your software from turning into an un-installable mess?</p>

<p>My current pet peeve is hard-coded configurations.  I'm in the process of working with our development team at my full-time job to simplify the deployment of our applications, so that I can totally automate every step of the deployment process.  A large chunk of the configuration for these apps is actually hard-coded, either at build time or in the codebase, which makes the process of actually setting the software up on a server very, very painful.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the team at my full-time gig is talented and wants to see this fixed as much as I do, so things are moving along smoothly.</p>

<p>As for a 'best practice', from a Unix perspective, I really like it when software is, or can be, self-contained.  So, I should be able to install an application into a directory, and then be able to move that directory around without causing the app to go utterly haywire.  This doesn't really take much more than a bit of startup path-detection, and it makes my life as a sysadmin so much nicer.</p>

<p>What are some ways that you simplify the deployment process (on both Windows and Unix) for server-type applications, and likewise, what are some things you've run into that have turned into a real nightmare when it came time to push the code out the door?</p>

"716259","1","716292","","2009-04-04 01:21:36","","5","54241","<p>Yesterday I had the need for a matrix type in Python.</p>

<p>Apparently, a trivial answer to this need would be to use <code>numpy.matrix()</code>, but the additional issue I have is that I would like a matrix to store arbitrary values with mixed types, similarly to a list. <code>numpy.matrix</code> does not perform this. An example is</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; numpy.matrix([[1,2,3],[4,""5"",6]])
matrix([['1', '2', '3'],
        ['4', '5', '6']], 
       dtype='|S4')
&gt;&gt;&gt; numpy.matrix([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
matrix([[1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6]])
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the <code>numpy.matrix</code> must be homogeneous in content. If a string value is present in my initialization, every value gets implicitly stored as a string. This is also confirmed by accessing the single values</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; numpy.matrix([[1,2,3],[4,""5"",6]])[1,1]
'5'
&gt;&gt;&gt; numpy.matrix([[1,2,3],[4,""5"",6]])[1,2]
'6'
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the Python list type can instead accept mixed types. You can have a list containing an integer and a string, both conserving their type. What I would need is something similar to a list, but operating in a matrix-like behavior. </p>

<p>Therefore, I had to implement my own type. I had two choices for the internal implementation: list containing lists, and dictionaries. Both solutions have shortcomings: </p>

<ul>
<li>list of lists require careful synchronization of the various lists' sizes. Swapping two rows is easy. Swapping two columns is less easy. Removing a row is easy as well.</li>
<li>dictionaries (with a tuple as a key) are slightly better, but you have to define the limits of your key (for example, you cannot insert element 5,5 if your matrix is 3x3), and they are more complex to use to insert, remove, or swap columns or rows.</li>
</ul>

<p>Edit: clarification. The concrete reason on why I need this functionality is because I am reading CSV files. Once I collect the values from a CSV file (values that can be string, integers, floats) I would like to perform swapping, removal, insertion and other operations alike. For this reason I need a ""matrix list"".</p>

<p>My curiosities are: </p>

<ul>
<li>do you know if a Python data type providing this service already exists (maybe in a ""non-battery included"" library out there)?</li>
<li>why is this data type not provided in the standard library? Too restricted interest maybe?</li>
<li>How would you have solved this need? Dictionary, list, or another smarter solution?</li>

<p>The initial attempts to get sIFR to initialize the menu was to set the selector to ""selector: '#menu'. This did not work at all. Slowly I started moving further and further into the nest of the div.</p>

<li>The anchor tags do not work when
clicking directly on the text that
should be active. However, if you
click on the far left or right of
the image LavaLamp uses as the
rollover, it will click the anchor.</li>
<li>When you roll over other items in
the menu, some times when you mouse
off, the last rolled over stays
highlighted, rather than returning
to the currently active menu item.</li>

<p>Is <code>drawRect()</code> meant to simply be a hook in which to execute your drawing code? Or is this method supposed to also redraw regions that are ""damaged"", and need repainting?  Can I just draw my stuff once and then it ""sticks"", or must I repaint the whole scene at any time via <code>drawRect()</code>?  Java's Graphics2D object works this way- you must draw your whole ""image"" every time paint() is called, so you must be prepared to re-construct it at any time (or cache it).</p>

<p>How would you implement a simple drawing program?  Would you have to ""remember"" each line/point/stroke that the user drew, and replicate that each time <code>drawRect()</code> is called?

I have ran into a brick wall of sorts though. Maybe its my somewhat poor understand of objective c but I can not seem to get this code for a view I was trying to write working:</p>

<pre><code>from objc import YES, NO, IBAction, IBOutlet

class SceneView(NSOpenGLView):
    def __init__(self):
        NSOpenGLView.__init__(self)
        self.renderer = None

    def doinit(self):
        self.renderer = gv.CoreRenderer()


    def initWithFrame_(self, frame):
        self = super(SceneView, self).initWithFrame_(frame)

        if self:
            self.doinit()
            print self.__dict__

        return self

    def drawRect_(self, rect):
        clearColor = [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]
        print self.__dict__
        self.renderer.clear(CF_Target|CF_ZBuffer,clearColor)
</code></pre>

<p>It outputs this when executed:</p>

<pre><code>{'renderer': &lt;gv.CoreRenderer; proxy of &lt;Swig Object of type 'GV::CoreRenderer *' at 0x202c7d0&gt; &gt;}

<p>It seems to be losing my renderer variable which is not that surprising considering how funky the initWithFrame_ code is but this was something xcode seemed to write which I suppose makes sense since objective C has the init separate from alloc idiom. It is still strange seeing it python however.</p>

<p>Is there anyways to salvage this or should I take it out behind the code shed shoot it and use QT or wxPython? I considered using objective-c but I want to test out these nifty swig bindings I just compiled =)</p>

<p>The class below contains the field city.</p>

<p>I need to dynamically determine the field's name as it is typed in the class declaration
i.e. I need to get the string ""city"" from an instance of the object city.</p>

<p>I have tried to do this by examining its Type in DoSomething() but can't find it when examining the contents of the Type in the debugger.</p>

<p>Is it possible?</p>

<pre><code>public class Person
{
  public string city = ""New York"";

  public Person()
  {
  }


  public void DoSomething()
  {
    Type t = city.GetType();

    string field_name = t.SomeUnkownFunction();
    //would return the string ""city"" if it existed!
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some people in their answers below have asked me why I want to do this.
Here's why.</p>

<p>In my real world situation, there is a custom attribute above city.</p>

<pre><code>[MyCustomAttribute(""param1"", ""param2"", etc)]
public string city = ""New York"";
</code></pre>

<p>I need this attribute in other code.
To get the attribute, I use reflection.
And in the reflection code I need to type the string ""city""</p>

<pre><code>MyCustomAttribute attr;
Type t = typeof(Person);

foreach (FieldInfo field in t.GetFields())
{

  if (field.Name == ""city"")
  {
    //do stuff when we find the field that has the attribute we need
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Now this isn't type safe.
If I changed the variable ""city"" to ""workCity"" in my field declaration in Person this line would fail unless I knew to update the string</p>

<pre><code>if (field.Name == ""workCity"")
//I have to make this change in another file for this to still work, yuk!
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I am trying to find some way to pass the string to this code without physically typing it.</p>

<p>Yes, I could declare it as a string constant in Person (or something like that) but that would still be typing it twice.</p>

<p>Phew! That was tough to explain!!</p>

<p><strong>Thanks</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to all who answered this * a lot*. It sent me on a new path to better understand lambda expressions. And it created a new question.</p>

<p>Some supporting arguments for <strong>Always Using jQuery</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can reference jQuery from Google's repository, where it might already be cached on the client, eliminating the extra hefty request</li>
<li>You don't have to deal with common cross-browser issues, as they are already taken care of</li>
<li>You enjoy writing the code because it is developer-friendly</li>
</ul>

<p>Some supporting arguments for <strong>Never Using jQuery</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unsettling dependency of a third-party library, which could contain costly bugs, and could lead to unjustifiably poor performance</li>
<li>You have to learn a new syntax (just when you thought you had regular Javascript figured out...)</li>
<li>Even the simplest of tasks can perform poorly, because of the inherent complexity of the framework</li>
</ul>

<p>I listed arguments as part of the question because I do not wish to have answers weighing the arguments of both sides.  I am hoping for always/never answers, preferrably with test case scenarios (vague <em>or</em> detailed).</p>

<p>For example: ""If I ever need to do any AJAX requests in my web app, I always use jQuery"".</p>

<p>Couple questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What's the best way to block IP addresses from certain countries like Nigeria?  (Note, I am using Ruby on Rails so any recommendations specific to that would be even better but if not thats fine too.)</p></li>
<li><p>What other techniques can I use besides blocking certain IP's?  (I'm already doing AVS and normal gateway checks).</p></li>
<li><p>What common scams do I need to check for?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For example, one I can think of is someone using the system to pay themselves, they receive the funds as payment (minus our fee) and then do a chargeback on the credit card.</p>

<p>I imagine these are similar to problems faced by sites like Paypal or Google Checkout (some call these aggregation sites) since they are taking a small percentage fee - so if the original source of funds is lost it's a huge loss (many time multiple of the profit involved unlike normal higher margin products).</p>

<p>Couple additional notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>My user accounts already require email validation - this is a bare minimum, I'm looking for something beyond this</li>
<li>There is a 3-5 day waiting period on the direct deposit - this is required by the bank - but still does not answer the question of how to determine during those 3-5 days whether it is fraud or not so it can be canceled</li>
<li>I'd prefer to avoid a solution which punishes the good people along with the bad - such as charging to signup or having them leave their funds there account until a withdrawal is requested (like Paypal)</li>

As Cody commented below, apparently my question was/is vague. Sorry about that, I'm trying to give as much info as possible, but am really a bit lost in this process. </p>

<p>When I've used memcache before, I have checked if the data exists in memcache based on a hash of the url request. If there was a match, i grabbed the cached data. If not, then I'd make the page and store it in the cache. </p>

<p>But as Ciaran has stated, it might make more sense to just take the hit of storing the non-gzipped data. </p>

<p>At the same time, it would be nicer to store the gzipped version, as it is both smaller so I could store more in the cache, and aren't almost all browsers gzip compatible?</p>

It is likely that I will have to resort to writing my own assembly cache, but I thought I would ask this question because I don't really want to ""re-invent the wheel"" if it has already been done.</p>

<p>I've got two COM objects, one that implements IAudioSessionEvents and one that implements IClassFactory and produces the first object.</p>

<p>The following code registers those objects (in accordance with my understanding of COM registration):</p>

<pre><code>BOOL RegisterClassManually(WCHAR* szGuid, WCHAR* szDllPath)

return S_OK;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've omitted RegisterKeyValue(...), its simple registry code that I've confirmed works as intended.</p>

<p>This code attempts to use these COM objects:</p>

<pre><code>IAudioSessionEvents* listener = NULL;

IClassFactory* factory = NULL;

//Fails on this call
hr = CoGetClassObject(CLSID_AudioEventsFactory, CLSCTX_ALL, NULL, __uuidof(IClassFactory), (void**)&amp;factory);

if(hr != S_OK)
{
    ... Report Error ...
}

hr = factory-&gt;CreateInstance(NULL, __uuidof(IAudioSessionEvents), (void**)&amp;listener);
</code></pre>

<p>The call to CoGetClassObject(...) returns hr = 0x80040111 (ClassFactory cannot supply requested class).</p>

<p>Implementation of DllGetClassObject (per 1800 INFORMATION pointing out the ommision):</p>

<pre><code>STDAPI DllGetClassObject(const CLSID&amp; clsid,
                     const IID&amp; iid,
                     void** ppv)

    {
        return pFact-&gt;QueryInterface(iid , ppv);
    }
}

return CLASS_E_CLASSNOTAVAILABLE;
}

<p>Because of the way the webservice works [sic] I have duplicates of the

<p>these text boxes will get user data from users to set their own database info. i have a button that saves the modified info back to the settings file</p>

<pre><code>private void button_save_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
   Properties.Settings.Default.Save();
}
</code></pre>

<p>but the design is not being saved. any help anyone?</p>

<p>regards,
Anjan</p>

<p><strong>To Cyril: Yes i had the code to assign modified value in properties, but then even the scope was set to ""User"" it said readonly. So i removed the property assignment codes.
now i brought the code back and restarted VS, it works perfect now :D silly me, i should have try this old procedure before.
Thank you Cyril.</strong></p>

<p>I'm not positive this use case is even relevant in git, but noting a file's path and/or revision numbers in the patch header included with cvs/svn give me a warm fuzzy that the patch that I have received, or created, is diffing against the correct source or revision.</p>

<p>Specifically, if we examine a git diff header:</p>

<pre><code>diff --git a/lib/blueprint/semantic_class_names.rb b/lib/blueprint/semantic_class_names.rb
index 41bd496..c17af1d 100644
--- a/lib/blueprint/semantic_class_names.rb
+++ b/lib/blueprint/semantic_class_names.rb
</code></pre>

<p>I can find no distinguishing information about the commits involved in this diff. There is an index line, that I can only assume is not an abbreviated commit hash, but rather a hash of the diffed portions of the files. It certainly doesn't match the associated commit signatures.</p>

<p>If I diff a couple files, and decide to go old school with an emailed patch, is there no way for me to double-check quickly that I've diffed the right files/revisions before sending out the patch I made with a quick glance at the header? I understand that revisions aren't as meaningful in git as they are in cvs/svn due to the distributed nature, but am I the only one who wouldn't mind seeing at least the abbreviated commit signature of the files in the header?</p>

I'm also new to C# and LINQ (just to complicate things further.)</p>

<p>I believe I have the data model suitably normalised but I may be wrong. Visual Studio generates a conceptual model that looks OK. I've pluralised the associations and EntitySets where necessary, but I'm struggling to perform what I think is a fairly basic query/projection on the data.</p>

<p>The database contains 3 tables:</p>

<pre><code>[Server]    - A server defined by the user that should be pinged.
ServerID    - primary key
HostAddress - IP or hostname

[Result]    - A result containing data about the last server test
ResultID    - primary key
ServerID    - foreign key on [Server].[ServerID]
StateID     - an integer used to lookup one of 3 possible Server states
TimeStamp   - Time stamp of last ping

[State]     - A lookup table containing an integer -&gt; string mapping.
StateID     - a unique key
StateLabel  - human-readable string like ""unreachable"" or ""OK"" or ""timeout""
</code></pre>

<p>I have manually populated the database using a few simple entries - just enough to give me something to work with. </p>

<p>For starters, I would like to present all of the Result data in a ListView on a WinForm. The ListView contains the following static columns:</p>

<p>State | Server Address | Last checked</p>

<p>In theory, the ListView's data needs to be generated by projecting(?) across each of the 3 tables:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ""State"" column should display the human-readable [State].[StateLabel] linked from [Result].[StateID]</li>
<li>The ""Server Address"" column should display [Server].[HostAddress] linked from [Result].[ServerID]</li>
<li>The ""Last Checked"" column should display [Result].[TimeStamp]</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Since I have no need for the object materialisation and/or change-tracking features of ObjectServices, am I correct in thinking it would be more efficient/correct to use Entity SQL/EntityClient and DbDataReader? If so, what would a suitable Entity SQL query look like?</strong></p>

<p>For what it's worth, I tried using LINQ to Entities and anonymous types in a method but was thwarted by a lack of understanding on a suitable return type:</p>

<pre><code>var results = from r in _context.Result
select new
{
    State = (from s in _context.State
         where s.StateId == r.StateId
         select s.StateLabel),
    r.ServerReference.Value.HostAddress,
    r.TimeStamp
};

return results.ToList(); // &lt;- No can do.

<p><strong>Version control is a solved problem.</strong> The main function of migrations is to keep a history of changes to your database. But storing a different file for each change is a clumsy way to track them. You don't create a new version of <code>post.rb</code> (or a file representing the delta) when you want to add a new <em>virtual</em> attribute -- why should you create a new migration when you want to add a new non-virtual attribute?</p>

<p>Put another way, just as you check <code>post.rb</code> into version control, why not check schema.rb into version control and make the changes to the file directly?</p>

<p>This is functionally the same as keeping a file for each delta, but it's much easier to work with. My mental model is ""I want table X to have such and such columns (or really, I want model X to have such and such properties)"" -- why should you have to infer from this how to get there from the existing schema; just open up <code>schema.rb</code> and give table X the right columns!</p>

<p>But even the idea that classes wrap tables is an implementation detail! Why can't I just open up <code>post.rb</code> and say:</p>

<pre><code> Class Post
    t.string :title
    t.text :body
 end
</code></pre>

<p>If you went with a model like this, you'd have to make a decision about what to do with existing data. But even then, migrations are overkill -- when you migrate data, you're going to lose fidelity when you use a migration's <code>down</code> method.</p>

<p>Anyway, my question is, <strong>even if you can't think of a better way, aren't migrations kind of gross?</strong></p>

<p>I have a non member function, <code>bool operator==( const MyClass&amp; obj1, const myClass&amp; obj2 )</code> defined oustide of my class.</p>

<p>I can't get at any of my private members for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>So what I think I need to do is to overload the assignment operator. And make assignments in the non member function.</p>

<p>With that said, I think I need to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>use my functions and copy information using <code>strcpy</code> or <code>strdup</code>. I used <code>strcpy</code>.</li>
<li>go to the assignment operator, bool MyClass::operator=( const MyClass&amp; obj1 );</li>
<li>Now we go to the function overloading (==) and assign obj2 to obj1.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't have a copy constructor, so I'm stuck with these:</p>

<pre><code>class Class
{
private:
m_1;
m_2;
public:
..
};

void Class::Func1(char buff[]) const
{   
    strcpy( buff, m_1 );
    return;
}
void Class::Func2(char buff[]) const
{
    strcpy( buff, m_2 );
    return;
}

bool Class&amp; Class::operator=(const Class&amp; obj)
{ 
    if ( this != &amp;obj ) // check for self assignment.
    {
        strcpy( m_1, obj.m_1 ); 
        // do this for all other private members.
    }
    return *this;
}

bool operator== (const Class&amp; obj1, const Class&amp; obj2)
{
         Class MyClass1, MyClass2;
    MyClass1 = obj1;
    MyClass2 = obj2;

         MyClass2 = MyClass1;
         // did this change anything?
// Microsofts debugger can not get this far.
    return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So as you can probably tell, I'm completely lost in this overloading. Any tips? I do have a completed version overloading the same operator, only with <code>::</code>, so my private members won't lose scope. I return my assignments as true and it works in <code>main</code>. Which is the example that I have in my book.</p>

<p>Will overloading the assignment operator and then preforming conversions in the <code>operator==</code> non member function work? Will I then be able to assign objects to each other in main after having completed that step?</p>

I often code in Windows on my main machine, and have my Mac laptop set up to the side. I use the Mac both to compile Mac builds but also as my ""reference web browser"".  There's no KVM or anything.</p>

<p>However a casual conversation at a conference led me to the question, could I use two independent machines to <strong>share</strong> windows? Literally move some windows from one machine to another, so I could use one PC's display as ""overflow"" from the other.</p>

<p>Some googling suddenly shows that this is possible in some situations for sure:</p>

<p><a href=""http://symless.com/synergy/second-screen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Synergy</a> and <a href=""http://www.maxivista.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maxivista</a></p>

<p>My question is whether any <strong>programmers</strong> have tried such a setup. We have unique needs especially with multiple text windows and editors, and this kind of tool may be a huge win or a huge hassle.</p>

<p>This solution feels like a combination of easy KVM switching AND multiple monitors.. it sounds like a programming dream! So advice or especially reports of actual experience in a programming environment would be greatly useful before I invest in the rather complex setup.</p>

<p>Followup:
Sounds like I'm asking for something that doesn't exist! It's kind of combination of a software KVM <strong>and</strong> VNC. But the VNC would need to break out the app windows and allow individual manipulation (like that maxivista commercial tool, which is Vista only).</p>

<p>Thanks for all the feedback. Looks like there's demand for a cool app if anyone has the drive to be first in this new nich!</p>

<h2>The environment</h2>

<p>I store items in a database with the following scheme :</p>

<pre><code>###################
#       Item      #    
###################
#      _id        #    This is the primary key
#    parent_id    #    If set, it the ID of the item containing this item
#      date       #    An ordinary date
#  geocontext_id  #    Foreign key to a pair of named coordinates
###################

###################
#   Geocontext    #    
###################
#       _id       #    This is the primary key
#       name      #    Way for the user to label a pair of coordinates (e.g : ""home"", ""work"")
#         x       #    One of the coordinate
#         y       #    The other one
###################
</code></pre>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>I must filter the items according to the geocontext  and the date. It would be a easy job if items were all at the same level, but the trick is it's recursive. E.G :</p>

<pre><code>root
      |_item 1
      |_item 2 
      |      |_item 4
      |      |_item 5
      |             |_item 6
      |_item 3
      |      |_item 8
      |             |_item 10
      |_item 11
      |       |_item 12
      |_item 7
</code></pre>

<p>There is no explicit limit to the recursive depth.</p>

<p>Now, if we are in any node and filter with the date ""1st of April"", we must see not only the items directly contained in the node that match the date, but <strong>we must see the items that contain items matching the date as well</strong>. </p>

<p>E.G : We are in ""Items 2"", if ""item 6"" matches the date, then we consider ""item 5"" matches the date too and we must keep it. If we are at the root, then item 2 must be displayed.</p>

<p>Same goes for the geocontext, but it's even harder because  :</p>

<ul>
<li>It's stored in an other table.</li>
<li>Matching the context is a costly mathematical computation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, brute forcing the matching would result in the software to be slow and a very poor user experience.</p>

<p>NOTE : <strong>I don't need to display a tree</strong>. I display a list of filtered data from a tree. We must see only a flat list of the top elements. The challenge is to decide whether to display each element or not, according to all the children hierachy.</p>

<h2>How I tried to solve it</h2>

<p>I thought I could ease a bit the problem by using more tables to cache flat data :</p>

<pre><code>###################
# Geocontex_cache #    
###################
#     item_id     #     I can Join the items table on this field
#     child_id    #     I can delete / update a child, and so delete / update the cache
#  geocontext_id  #     I can delete / update a geocontext, and so delete / update the cache
#        x        #      Here, I can brute force :-)
#        y        # 
###################

###################
#    Date_cache   #    
###################
#     item_id     #     
#     child_id    #    
#       date      #    
###################
</code></pre>

<p>This seems reasonable, but I haven't tried it yet. Nevertheless, it should the following drawbacks :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I moved the costly process to the get
/ set / create / delete methods that
will have to manage the cached date.
That will be a troublesome code to
write and maintain. A five depth
level item will triger a process that
will hit recursively five parents.</p></li>
<li><p>The size ot the data base could
become HUGE.  A five de depth level
item store cached data for five
parents. Don't know if it's relevant,
since this a a mono-user app with a
manual input. I don't think anybody
would insert more thatn 1000 items
with more than 10 level of depth.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now the good news is we go from the
   bottom of the pyramid to the top, not
   the other way, so it's not has
   horrible as it seems. When I will
   have to deal with parent item
   deletion, it will be another nice
   headache, but I save it for another
   question ;-).</p>

<h2>Now my question</h2>

<p>How would you store the data and process the filtering int the most optimal way ?</p>

<p><em>Optional :</em></p>

<p>Should I define an explicit recursive depth limit ?
Should I perform the filtering using SQL or Java ? SQL surely will be faster, but matching the geocontext is far easier to do in Java.</p>

<p>As I am working on the Android platform, I have the following constraints :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Java is the only language available,
and not with the entire standard lib.</p></li>
<li><p>SQLite is the only DBMS available.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance and memory are important
issues. In case you have to choose,
battery life and therefore
performance is the priority.</p></li>
<li><p>Exotics external libs may not be able
to be used.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>P.S : I dug into SO and found some interesting pieces of information (espacially <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/192220/what-is-the-most-efficientelegant-way-to-parse-a-flat-table-into-a-tree"">What is the most efficient/elegant way to parse a flat table into a tree?</a>).

<p>This solution takes a few milliseconds to compute. Much faster than the System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement based approach I tried before.</p>

<p>There is one last thing that bothers me, though. I have to translate the SecurityIdentifier of the admin group to the name. There ought to be a way to get
the DirectoryEntry directly by using the SID. According to Google, this should work:</p>

<pre><code>string path = ""LDAP://&lt;SID="" + adminIdentifier.ToString() + ""&gt;"";

"717003","1","717048","","2009-04-04 12:39:44","","4","558","<p>I was wondering how i should go about writing an XML data layer for a fairly simple php web site. The reasons for this are:</p>

<ol>
<li>db server is not available.</li>
<li>Simple data schema that can be expressed in xml.</li>
<li>I like the idea of having a self contained app, without server dependencies.</li>
<li>I would possibly want to abstract it to a small framework for reuse in other projects.</li>
</ol>

<p>The schema resembles a simple book catalog with a few lookup tables plus i18n. So, it is quite simple to express.</p>

<p>The size of the main xml file is in the range of 100kb to 15mb. But it could grow at some point to ~100mb.</p>

<p>I am actually considering extending my model classes to handle xml data. 
Currently I fetch data with a combination of XMLReader and SimpleXml, like this:</p>

<pre><code>public function find($xpath){            

    while($this-&gt;xml_reader-&gt;read()){

        if($this-&gt;xml_reader-&gt;nodeType===XMLREADER::ELEMENT &amp;&amp; 
           $this-&gt;xml_reader-&gt;localName == 'book' ){


            $node = $this-&gt;xml_reader-&gt;expand();
            $dom = new DOMDocument();
            $n = $dom-&gt;importNode($node, true);
            $dom-&gt;appendChild($n);
            $sx = simplexml_import_dom($n); 


            // xpath returns an array

            $res = $sx-&gt;xpath($xpath);

            if(isset($res[0]) &amp;&amp; $res[0]){

                $this-&gt;results[] = $res;                        
            }
    }

    return $this-&gt;results;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, instead of loading the whole xml file in memory, I create a SimpleXml object for each section and run an xpath query on that object. The function returns an array of SimpleXml objects. For conservative search I would probably break on first found item.</p>

<p>The questions i have to ask are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Would you consider this as a viable solution, even for a medium to large data store?</li>
<li>Are there any considerations/patterns to keep in mind, when handling XML in PHP?</li>
<li>Does the above code scale for large files (100mb)?</li>
<li>Can inserts and updates in large xml files be handled in a low overhead manner?</li>
<li>Would you suggest an alternative data format as a better option?</li>

<hr>

<p>In my job I often need to use third-made API to access remote system.
For instance to create a request and send it to the remote system:</p>

<pre><code>   #include ""external_lib.h""
   void SendRequest(UserRequest user_request)
   {
       try
       {
           external_lib::Request my_request;
           my_request.SetPrice(user_request.price);
           my_request.SetVolume(user_request.quantity);
           my_request.SetVisibleVolume(user_request.quantity);
           my_request.SetReference(user_request.instrument);
           my_request.SetUserID(user_request.user_name);
           my_request.SetUserPassword(user_request.user_name);
           // Meny other member affectations ...
       }
       catch(external_lib::out_of_range_error&amp; e)
       {
           // Price , volume ????
       }
       catch(external_lib::error_t&amp; e)
       {
           // Here I need to tell the user what was going wrong
       }
   }
</code></pre>

<p>Each lib's setter do checks the values that the end user has provided, and may thow an exception when the user does not comply with remote system needs. For instance a specific user may be disallowed to send a too big volume. That's an example, and actually many times users tries does not comply: no long valid instrument, the prices is out of the limit, etc, etc.
<em>Conseqently, our end user <strong>need</strong> an explicit error message to tell him what to modify in its request to get a second chance to compose a valid request. I have to provide hiim such hints</em></p>

<p>Whatever , external lib's exceptions (mostly) never specifies which field is the source
of aborting the request.</p>

<p>What is the best way, according to you, to handle those exceptions?</p>

<p>My first try at handling those exceptions was to ""wrap"" the Request class with mine. Each setters are then wrapped in a method which does only one thing : a try/catch block. The catch block then throws a new exceptions of mine : my_out_of_range_volume, or my_out_of_range_price depending on the setter. For instance SetVolume() will be wrapped this way:</p>

<pre><code>My_Request::SetVolume(const int volume) 
{
    try
    {
        m_Request.SetVolume(volume);
    }
    catch(external_lib::out_range_error&amp; e)
    {
        throw my_out_of_range_volume(volume, e);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>What do you think of it? What do you think about the exception handling overhead it implies? ... :/</p>

<p>Well the question is open, I need new idea to get rid of that lib constraints!</p>

<p>The Keychain Access app does not offer any such functionality, and getting a key's data involves opening each in turn, and having to type in the keychain's password to see the password stored with the key, every time.</p>

<p>After a bit of digging, I found somebody's solution by using AppleScript and the Keychain Scripting app to access keychains (can't link to individual post; scroll down about two thirds to the end of the page):</p>

<p><a href=""http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1398759"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1398759</a></p>

<p>Using Keychain scripting, you can access all data fields of all the keys – including the plaintext password! – and it's fairly easy to dump this data into a text file etc. I've tested it and it works well.</p>

<p>However, this solution still involves having to confirm access to each key by clicking OK on a dialog. This is much better than having to type in the keychain's password every time, but it's still irritating. Furthermore, you have to confirm access twice for each key; once for Script Editor (or the script itself if it's running as an app) and once for Keychain Scripting. So, if you're processing a keychain with 100 keys, you have to manually click OK on 200 dialogs.</p>

<p>I'm now looking for a solution to get around this. I realize that as it's the purpose of keychains to safeguard the sensitive data and prevent precisely the kind of thing I'm trying to do, any such solution would probably involve some kind of hack.</p>

<p>I'd be very interested in your ideas!</p>

On Windows, we ask every developer check out projects into d:\dev\product folder, and copy a unified Workspace to d:\dev\prod_workspace. This way, whenever a new machine is set, we simply copy files to the same folder, and we can start working immediately.</p>

<p>Now we need to move our development environment to Linux and Mac. But there's no D:\ on Unix. And home folder for Linux is mostly like /home/username and /Users/username for Mac. We found Eclipse keeps absolute path in workspace when referring to projects, so simply copy workspace over does not work anymore.

<p>From the info I gathered so far, when sending the http request I need to add a header field with a key of ""Range"" and the value ""bytes=startoff-endoff"". Then the server returns a http response with the data between those offsets.</p>

<p>So roughly what I have in mind is to split the file to the number of allowed connections per file and send a http request per splitted part with the appropriate ""Range"". So if I have a 4mb file and 4 allowed connections, I'd split the file to 4 and have 4 http requests going, each with the appropriate ""Range"" field. Implementing the resume feature would involve remembering which offsets are already downloaded and simply not request those.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this the right way to do this?</li>
<li>What if the web server doesn't support resuming? (my guess is it will ignore the ""Range"" and just send the entire file)</li>
<li>When sending the http requests, should I specify in the range the entire splitted size? Or maybe ask smaller pieces, say 1024k per request?</li>
<li>When reading the data, should I write it immediately to the file or do some kind of buffering? I guess it could be wasteful to write small chunks.</li>
<li>Should I use a memory mapped file? If I remember correctly, it's recommended for frequent reads rather than writes (I could be wrong). Is it memory wise? What if I have several downloads simultaneously?  </li>
<li>If I'm not using a memory mapped file, should I open the file per allowed connection? Or when needing to write to the file simply seek? (if I did use a memory mapped file this would be really easy, since I could simply have several pointers).</li>

<p>From googling this problem the Illegal instruction is just a signal that the system uses to kill the process, and not related to the problem.

In theory, this is great and I can pass defines to <code>GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS</code> for use in my code.  However, I'm having problems actually getting it to work due to an error trying to launch the second target in the simulator: <code>Failed to launch simulated application: Unknown error.</code></p>

<p>Here is the simple process I'm using to create the additional target:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add #ifdef MYAPP_PRO to source files to modify behavior based on pro/lite version of app (and verify application is working as expected)</li>
<li>Select <code>Project</code> > <code>New Target...</code> from menu, and pick ""Cocoa Touch Application"" (named MyAppPro"")</li>
<li>Edit new target settings; add <code>GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS</code> user-defined setting and set the value to ""MYAPP_PRO"" (no quotes)</li>
<li>Set active target to ""MyAppPro""; build and run.</li>
<li><code>Failed to launch simulated application: Unknown error.</code></li>
<li>Copy all settings from Info.plist to MyAppPro-Info.plist and try again</li>
<li><code>Failed to launch simulated application: Unknown error.</code></li>
</ol>

<p>The build completes just fine, but I'm unable to run in simulator.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>The Idea is to notify the user using the memo when a packet is received/sent in a TCP Client.</p>

<p>After couple of fixes,the most suitable solution seemed to be this one</p>

<pre><code>    public string TextValue
    {
        set
        {
            this.Memo.Text += value + ""\n"";
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>That's how it's being called</p>

<pre><code>    var form = Form.ActiveForm as Form1;
    if(form != null)
        form.TextValue = ""Test asdasd"";
</code></pre>

<p>However,calling the code throws an exception ,because of Unsafe thread call.I found a solution at <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171728.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">msdn</a>,but I can't seem to acquire the method they've used there.</p>

<p>This is my remake,which doesn't work.</p>

<pre><code>    private void SetTextMemo(string txt)
    {
        if(this.Memo.InvokeRequired)
        {
            this.Invoke(SetTextMemo,txt); //error here
        }
        else
        {
            this.Memo.Text += txt + ""\n"";
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>errors:</p>

<p>Argument '1': cannot convert from 'method group' to 'System.Delegate'</p>

<p>Argument '2': cannot convert from 'string' to 'object[]'</p>

<p>Basically,I'm trying to access the Memo(or more likely said,add text to the memo) from another thread using Invoke.I never used it before,maybe that's why I misunderstand my mistake.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All of the current Ruby
  implementations are compiled to
  bytecode. Contrary to SAP's claims, as
  of Ruby 1.9, MRI itself includes a
  bytecode compiler, though the ability
  to save the compiled bytecode to disk
  disappeared somewhere in the process
  of merging the YARV virtual machine.
  JRuby is compiled into Java .class
  files. I don't have a lot of details
  on MagLev, but it seems safe to say it
  will take that road as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I learned that Ruby is an interpreted language and that's why when I save changes to my Ruby files I don't need to re-build the project.</p>

<p>We have many objects form one class, for instance a picture frame. Now each of the picture frames can display 3 types of picture. 1) a face 2) a screenshot 3) empty</p>

<p>Thats easy:</p>

<pre><code>public enum PictureMode 
{
    Face,
    Screen,
    None
}

public class PictureFrame {
    private PictureMode mode;
    public PictureMode Mode 
    {
        get { retrun mode; }
        set { /* set currentPicture to the correct one */ }
    }

    private Image currentPicture;
    private Image face;
    private Image screen;
    private Image empty;

    public PictureFrame(Image face, Image screen) {
        this.face = face;
        this.screen = screen;

        mode = PictureMode.None; // Maybe this is our default.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can now create some PictureFrames with different pictures and easily change the mode for each one.</p>

<p>Now I want to add a global setter for all PictureFrames. Then each new PictureFrame should take the global setting as the default one. It can later be set to an different through.</p>

<p>Here is my solution, but I want to discuss if there is a better one.</p>

<p>I added a static field PictureFrame.Instances to the PictureFrame class where all PictureFrames are reachable. Now I can iterate over all the PictureFrames to apply the new global mode to all frames.</p>

<p>In addition I have a second static field PictureFrame.GlobalImageMode where I set the global mode if I change it on all Frames and read it in the Constructor of the PictureFrame. The setter for the GlobalImageMode can be static in the PictureFrame class, too.</p>

<p>I have an account on a shared host with 2 domains registered.  I'm using the Asp.Net stack to run a few things like a blog and another site I am planning to kick off eventually.  Both of my domains point to the root; the first is the original I used to signup, the second is a root domain pointer I added.  Here is how I want it to behave:</p>

<p>Directory Structure:</p>

<pre>
Root                      (www.domain1.com)
Root --\ Blog             (www.domain1.com/blog)
Root --\ Site2            (should be directed here if www.domain2.com)
Root --\ Site2 --\ Junk   (www.domain2.com/junk)
</pre>

<p>Right now, if you type in www.domain1.com or www.domain1.com/blog, that behaves as expected and I am fine with that.  For www.domain2.com, I have the rewrite rule configured like this(from the web.config):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;rule name=""Domain2""&gt;
    &lt;match url=""(.*)(/)?"" ignoreCase=""false"" /&gt;
    &lt;conditions logicalGrouping=""MatchAll""&gt;
        &lt;add input=""{HTTP_HOST}"" pattern=""(www\.)?domain2\.com"" ignoreCase=""false"" /&gt;
    &lt;/conditions&gt;
    &lt;action type=""Rewrite"" url=""/site2/{R:1}"" /&gt;
&lt;/rule&gt;

<p>That rule is supposed to match any path if the host is domain2.com, pick off the path to the requested resource and format it properly.  So when somebody types www.domain2.com/junk/default.aspx, in IIS, this resolves to www.domain2.com/site2/junk/default.aspx without the user ever knowing.  This is <em>mostly</em> working as advertised except when the user does not type a trailing slash in a subfolder.  IE: <br /></p>

<p>www.domain2.com (works) <br />
www.domain2.com/ (works) <br />
www.domain2.com/junk/ (works) <br />
www.domain2.com/junk (doesn't work!)  IIS 7 looses its brain here and formats it out like www.domain2.com/site2/junk because a 2nd request is automatically issued for the trailing slash and a 404 happens.  </p>

<p>So, I updated the action to be:  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;action type=""Rewrite"" url=""/site2/{R:1}/"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to have resolved it, but why doesn't IIS 7 now spit out www.domain2.com/junk2/default.aspx/ ?  How does it know not to append a trailing slash to a document extension?</p>

I have a MathLib static lib and a Render static lib that is being linked by my TestBed exe. Right now Render has two classes: Color and DXManager3D. Color includes my Vector.h from MathLib just fine, no problems. </p>

<p>The second I try to include Vector.h in DXManager3D it blows up on me, saying the symbol is defined twice, and the second definition is ignored (warning from lib). I thought maybe including it twice was causing this so as a test I removed Vector.h from Color.h and left it in DXManager3D.h - same problem. I have triple checked to make sure I have everything wrapped in ifndef to protect from this, so I am left scratching my head.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DXManager3D.obj : warning LNK4006: ""public: __thiscall Math::Vector::Vector(void)"" (??0Vector@Math@@QAE@XZ) already defined in Render.obj; second definition ignored</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What really confuses me is that when I build the Render.lib separate from TestBed, which should not be linking anything as it is a static lib, right? I still get the multiple symbol definition warnings. If I instantiate a DXManager3D in main my warnings become errors.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Render.lib(DXManager3D.obj) : error LNK2005: ""public: __thiscall Math::Vector::Vector(void)"" (??0Vector@Math@@QAE@XZ) already defined in WinMain.obj</p>

<p><strong>Resolved:</strong> I tracked this to an HTTP redirect I had in my request handling code. So the function handling the POST request would throw a redirect, and IE does not like it. I had a total mental constipation at the time, and I don't really need the redirect.</p>

<p>Sorry for any confusion - It wasn't my intention to host each <em>every</em> service operation in a different contract, only to group them sensibly.  My problem stems from the fact that I thought that it wasn't possible to host multiple ServiceHosts on one port. </p>

<p>I think that @Koystya and co's approach of implementing each interface on a single concrete object and hosting it in a single ServiceHost is also a good pragmatic solution to my question. Especially if you treat that single concrete object as a sort of Facade. One downside I can think of tho, is that you wouldn't be able to have different ServiceBehaviors depending on the contract.</p>

<p>Also, I do agree with Joe's logic of when it's appropriate to implement multiple service contracts on one concrete class.</p>

<li>Draw a <code>rect()</code> around ""<code>_+v\_stat5a\_01_</code>"" and ""<code>_+v\_stat5b\_01_</code>""</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>markSignificantClusters &lt;&lt;- function (n) {
  if (!is.leaf(n)) {
     a &lt;- attributes(n)
     leafList &lt;- unlist(dendrapply(n, listLabels))

          # I now have a node ""n"" that contains significant leaves, and
          # I'd like to use a dendrapply() call to another local function
          # which colors the edges that run down to the leaves; or, draw
          # a rect() around the leaves
       }
     }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>From within this <code>if</code> block, I have tried calling <code>dendrapply(n, markEdges)</code>, but this did not work:</p>

<pre><code>markEdges &lt;&lt;- function (n) {
  a &lt;- attributes(n)
  attr(n, ""edgePar"") &lt;- c(a$edgePar, list(lty=3, col=""red""))
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my ideal example, the edges connecting ""<code>_+v\_stat5a\_01_</code>"" and ""<code>_+v\_stat5b\_01_</code>"" would be dashed and of a red color.</p>

<p>I have also tried using <code>rect.hclust()</code> within this <code>if</code> block:</p>

<pre><code>ma &lt;- match(leafList, orderedLabels)  
rect.hclust(scoreClusterObj, h = a$height, x = c(min(ma), max(ma)), border = 2)
</code></pre>

<p>But the result does not work with horizontal dendrograms (<em>i.e.</em> dendrograms with horizontal labels). <a href=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3331/3410126060_f8f06c4498_o.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is an example</a> (note the red stripe in the lower-right corner). Something is not correct about the dimensions of what <code>rect.hclust()</code> generates, and I don't know how it works, to be able to write my own version.</p>

<p>I appreciate any advice for getting <code>edgePar</code> or <code>rect.hclust()</code> to work properly, or to be able to write my own <code>rect.hclust()</code> equivalent.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Since asking this question, I used <code>getAnywhere(rect.hclust())</code> to get the functional code that calculates parameters and draws the <code>rect</code> object. I wrote a custom version of this function to handle horizontal and vertical leaves, and call it with <code>dendrapply()</code>.</p>

<p>However, there is some kind of clipping effect that removes part of the <code>rect</code>. For horizontal leaves (leaves that are drawn on the right side of the tree), the rightmost edge of the <code>rect</code> either disappears or is thinner than the border width of the other three sides of the <code>rect</code>. For vertical leaves (leaves that are drawn on the bottom of the tree), the bottommost edge of the <code>rect</code> suffers the same display problem.</p>

<p>What I had done as a means of marking significant clusters is to reduce the width of the <code>rect</code> such that I render a vertical red stripe between the tips of the cluster edges and the (horizontal) leaf labels. </p>

<p>This eliminates the clipping issue, but introduces another problem, in that the space between the cluster edge tips and the leaf labels is only six or so pixels wide, which I don't have much control over. This limits the width of the vertical stripe. </p>

<p>The worse problem is that the <code>x</code>-coordinate that marks where the vertical stripe can fit between the two elements will change based on the width of the larger tree (<code>par[""usr""]</code>), which in turn depends on how the tree hierarchy ends up being structured.</p>

<p>I wrote a ""correction"" or, better termed, a hack to adjust this <code>x</code> value and the <code>rect</code> width for horizontal trees. It doesn't always work consistently, but for the trees I am making, it seems to keep from getting too close to (or overlapping) edges and labels.</p>

<p>The ""Ask A Scientist"" website provides <a href=""http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/math99/math99028.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">this answer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The general form of a parabola is given by the equation: A * x^2 + B * x + C = y where A, B, and C are arbitrary Real constants. You have three pairs of points that are (x,y) ordered pairs. Substitute the x and y values of each point into the equation for a parabola. You will get three LINEAR equations in three unknowns, the three constants. You can then easily solve this system of three equations for the values of A, B, and C, and you'll have the equation of the parabola that intersects your 3 points. The vertex is where the first derivative is 0, a little algebra gives: ( -B/2A , C - B^2/4A ) for the vertex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember long ago when i first learned about NAT (i used it for sharing a dialup 14.4kbps modem), i thought that someday every home would have a router with NAT included, but it would ""obviously"" need also a SOCKS process to be able to open listening ports.  When broadband started appearing, it was nice to see NAT as a common feature, and I supposed that SOCKS would be an extra, and slowly become more and more common...  but nothing!  i had to manually forward ports.  then appeared that uPNP, but very few 'serious' applications support it, mostly P2P sharing, games, and some IM.</p>

<p>I still haven't seen any home router to include SOCKS (apart from Linux-based firmware upgrades, of course).  does anybody know why??</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>as Vartec noted, UPnP is a zeroconf and service discovery, not proxy service.  now i know that what i'm referring to is IGD protocol, the NAT traversal service present in home routers, and discovered via UPnP.  so, my question would more properly be ""Why IGD/UPnP instead of SOCKS?""</p>

<p>The library -lgmp is found in /sw/lib, so I can run that command (""/usr/bin/gcc ..."") successfully if I manually add -L/sw/lib.  The problem is that sudo doesn't know about /sw/lib.  Behold:</p>

<p>How do I tell the sudo version of gcc to look in /sw/lib for libraries?  Do I add an environment variable on root's .bash_profile?  If so, which one?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
There’s probably a more proper way to do this, but here’s what worked. I created a bash script with this in it:</p>

<p>That compiled zlib without complaining - hooray! Unfortunately cabal-install is still giving me the error:</p>

<p>So I went back to the cabal-install dir (which is what I'm trying to do in the first place), and ran...</p>

<p>The problem is that while Java doubles have no problem with a number like:</p>

<pre><code>0.0000000000000000000000000000000001 (1.0E-34)
</code></pre>

<p>they can't represent something like:</p>

<pre><code>1.0000000000000000000000000000000001
</code></pre>

<p>Consequently of this I lose precision rapidly (the limit seems to be around 1.000000000000001 for Java's doubles).</p>

<p>I've considered just storing the numbers with 1 subtracted, so for example 1.0001 would be stored as 0.0001 - but the problem is that to multiply them together again I have to add 1 and at this point I lose precision.</p>

<p>To address this I could use BigDecimals to perform the calculation (convert to BigDecimal, add 1.0, then multiply), and then convert back to doubles afterwards, but I have serious concerns about the performance implications of this.</p>

<p>Can anyone see a way to do this that avoids using BigDecimal?</p>

<p><strong>Edit for clarity</strong>: This is for a large-scale collaborative filter, which employs a gradient descent optimization algorithm.  Accuracy is an issue because often the collaborative filter is dealing with very small numbers (such as the probability of a person clicking on an ad for a product, which may be 1 in 1000, or 1 in 10000).</p>

<p>Speed is an issue because the collaborative filter must be trained on tens of millions of data points, if not more.</p>

<p>You see, I am lazy, and I know Mobile Safari can support URI's up to 80 000 characters, so I think this is a OK way to do it. If there is something really wrong with this, please tell me.  </p>

<p>I have a [User] table in my database, with the basic stuff you'd expect, like username, password, etc...</p>

<p>This application requires that I track a vast number of attributes for each user.  So much so, that I will likely run out of columns (row storage space).</p>

<p>I'm tempted to add a UserProperties table with UserID, PropertyKey and PropertyValue columns.  This approach fits well with the requirements.</p>

<p>My concern is that if each user has say 100 properties, when the database has a million users in it, we'll have 100,000,000 property rows.</p>

<p>I would think that with a clustered index on the UserID, that access will still be screaming fast, and you are really storing about the same amount of data as you would with the mega-columns approach.</p>

<p>Any ideas or thoughts on performance concerns?  Ideas for a better DB design?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>First, thanks so much for all the great responses!</p>

<p>I have been toying around with the possibilities, and one thing keeps bothering me.  I need to query on some of these attributes pretty frequently, and worse yet, these queries could involve finding all users who match criteria on as many as 10 of these attributes at the same time.</p>

<p>As a result, I am now leaning towards the mega-column approach, but possibly splitting the data off into one (or more) separate tables, forming a one-to-one relationship keyed on the UserID.</p>

<p>I'm using LinqToSql, and while I think tables with this many columns are inelegant, I think considering all the challenges and trade-offs, it is probably the right one, but I am still eager to hear other opinions.</p>

<p>What's the right way to do this?  Obviously regular expressions would be a good way to go, but I can't figure out how to trap the beginning of field along with the crlf (carriage return/linefeed) combo in a sane way.</p>

<p>I want generate the following input/output at console.</p>

<pre><code>Window size? (x, y) : 250, 200

<p>The 250/200 would be user input, so for example, at first you see</p>

<p>and after typing ""200"" and hitting enter you get</p>

<pre><code>Window size? (x, y) : 250, 200

<p>and then it continues on with the program.</p>

<p>As a second question, I'm wondering if it's possible to have a user input an equation. I was thinking about storing what they type into a string, but that would just be text and would need to be transferred into a Java runnable equation.</p>

My TA said that I have to use temporary file. This temporary file will read line by line to find what the user is looking for. However, I did not understand this temporary OPEN file at all. Does anyone explain what that is, and if it's possible, would you attach example of it?</p>

<p><strong>Here are the project instructions:</strong>
This project is about writing a program to perform transactions on bank accounts. You will be given a file which contains all the accounts in the bank (the file is named “account.txt”). Your program is to provide an interactive menu for users to perform transactions on these accounts. Your program needs to update the account file after each transaction. The user may perform transactions on accounts that are not available. Your program needs print an error message on the screen and return to the menu. In addition, your program needs to print whether a transaction is successful. For unsuccessful transaction, your program will print out the reason for the failed transaction.</p>

<p>Your program needs to be able to handle the following transactions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deposit money into an account</li>
<li>Withdraw money from an account</li>
<li>Check cashed against an account</li>
<li>Balance inquiry of an account</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a limit on how many checks can be cashed against a saving account. The limit is 2 checks per month. There is a $0.25 penalty for each check cashed over the limit. If there is enough fund to cash the check but not the penalty, the transaction should go through and the resulting balance would be zero.</p>

<p>Here is the format in the account file for one account (data fields are separated by exactly one space):</p>

<pre><code>Account type, S for saving, C for checking (1 character)
Account number of 5 digits
Last name of account holder (15 characters)
First name of account holder (15 characters)
Balance of the account in the form xxxxx.xxx
An integer field indicating how many checks have been cahsed this month (three digit)
An interest rate in the form of xx.xx (e.g. 10.01 = 10.01%)
For names with fewer than 15 characters, the data will be padded to have width of 15 characters.
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example of the account file:</p>

<pre><code>C 12345 Smith           John              100.000  10  0.00
S 45834 Doe             Jane             3462.340   0  0.30
C 58978 Bond            Jones              13.320   5  0.00
</code></pre>

<p>*Creating temporary file
There is a way in FORTRAN to create a temporary file. Use:
OPEN(UNIT = , STATUS = ""SCRATCH"", ...)
There is no need to provide (FILE = ””). By using a temporary file, you can copy the accounts from the account file to the temporary file. Then when you copy the data back from the temporary file to the account file, perform the necessary transactions. Your program should not copy accounts between these two files if a transaction is to be failed.</p>

<p>When modeling a relational database from an existing object hierarchy it is generally the case that non-primitive child properties should go in their own tables with a reference to the ID of the parent object (table-row thingy).  It seems a little backwards from an OO standpoint (and obviously I realize that relational is way different from OO) but I guess it's the only way to represent one-to-many relationships (which feels like it should be more accurately described as many-to-one as the one parent doesn't reference the many children, it's many child entries that reference the one parent)</p>

<p>In the '92/'93 time frame I worked on a plugin architecture for Aldus PageMaker, which was coded in C++. PageMaker was built on a C++ OOP framework called VAMP, which assisted its portability between Mac OS and Windows.</p>

<p>So we tried to use the features of C++ to build a plugin architecture. This proved to be very problematic for C++ classes due to the so-called brittle base class problem.</p>

<p>I proceeded to write a paper that was published in journals and that I presented at OOPSLA '93 in a reflection workshop. You can read the pdf format of the paper I presented here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.51.418"" rel=""noreferrer"">Time Invariant Virtual Member Function Dispatching For C++ Evolvable Classes</a>
(Page to the bottom and click <em>View or Download</em>)</p>

<p>I also made contact with Bjarne Stroustrup at a Usenix conference in Portland and proceeded to dialog with him for several months, where he championed the issue of dealing with the brittle base class problem on my behalf. (Alas, other issues were deemed more important at that time - for instance, trying to shepard RTTI through approval.)</p>

<p>Microsoft at this time introduced the COM/DCOM system for the Windows platform that was looked on as a viable solution to the problem. C++ could be used as an implementation language for COM via abstract classes used to define COM interfaces.</p>

<p>However, these days developers shun COM/DCOM - and especially ActiveX, that was based on COM. (In 1994 I went on to work at Microsoft and used C++ and COM/DCOM there for the remainder of the decade. I came to conclude that the technology combination was a definite dead-end. I refer to that experience here: <a href=""http://humbleblogger.blogspot.com/2006/08/building-effective-enterprise.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Building Effective Enterprise Distributed Software Systems</a>)</p>

<p>In contrast to all this early C++ history, Steve Job's company, NeXT, devised a plugin architecture using Objective C during the early 90s, and that was integral to the NeXT Step framework. Today that lives on vibrantly in Mac OS X on Apple's computers and important platforms such as the iPhone.</p>

<p>I submit Objective C enabled solving the plugin problem in a superior manner.</p>

<p>The champions of Java will cite factors such as garbage collection as to why it is more productive than C++. I won't dispute that, but Objective C has not had garbage collection until very recently with 2.0. On the iPhone garbage collection is still not available. None-the-less, the OS X plugin architecture has been entirely viable - due entirely to the merits of Objective C style of OOP vs C++ OOP.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Java has been used to build the most pervasive plugin architectures that exist for any platform or software development community. The Eclipse IDE plugin architecture, which by now is practically legendary, as such architectures go, incorporated a few years ago the Equinox OSGi module management layer. J2EE app servers have supported a <em>plugin architecture</em> for EJBs for a decade. These days all J2EE app servers of note have likewise incorporated OSGi to manage runtime bindable modules. The Spring Framework and its runtime bindable unit of the Spring Bean has grown to exceed J2EE - primarily on the strength of its system for managing the binding in of the Spring Bean.</p>

<p>The Java community is still struggling to define an official module management standard yet even as things stand, the Java platform supports software architectures that incorporate plugin capability more pervasively than any other programming platform.</p>

<p>Despite the weaknesses of Java as a language relative to C#, and that .NET already has a stronger module implementation in its .NET assembly standard, Java is still light years ahead in terms of everyday software systems in wide use that incorporate some form of plugin architecture. Strangely, the Java community doesn't even consciously realize that this is the underpinning of their continued success as an enterprise development platform.</p>

<p>I personally regard the brittle base class problem of C++ to be it's most fatal flaw.</p>

<p>After 17 years have passed since this issue was highlighted to the C++ community, and to the creator of C++, is it now too late to address it?</p>

<p>Like any image editor, the user will use 'tools' to draw on and manipulate an image.  My first attempt at this consisted of a simple interface:</p>

{

<p>This (I thought) would be nice and clean and would allow for easy maintenance and extension.  Just add the interface objects in and call the DrawEffect method of the selected one at runtime.  </p>

<p>The problem with this approach is that different drawing tools do not cleanly adhere to a single interface.  For example, a pen tool need only know the point to draw at in order to work.  The rectangle however needs the first point clicked, as well as the current position.  The polygon tool needs to keep track of multiple mouse clicks.</p>

<p>I am having trouble thinking of a nice way to implement this.  The best method that I can think of now would involve a switch statement and a case for each tool, which would mean that the drawing logic would be in the Canvas class, not encapsulated by Tool type objects.  because this is practice, I would like to do this the right way.

<p>I would like users to be able to navigate through the available video podcasts and stream them from the internets. That's really easy cause media player etc.. will happily play a file that lives in the cloud. </p>

<p>The problem is that I want cache these files locally so subsequent viewings of the same episode will not involve streaming and instead will play the local file.</p>

<p>So... I was thinking, why not host an <code>HttpListener</code> and as media player asks it for bits of the file, have the <code>HttpListener</code> download and store it locally. Next time a user plays the file we will already have portions of the file locally.  </p>

<p>Does anyone know of example code that uses <code>HttpListener</code> for proxying? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>The idea would be only to proxy simple streamable content like MP3 or Mov. 
The bounty will go to an actual implementation.</p>

<p>Here is the API I would like:</p>

<pre><code>// will proxy a uri on the local port, if cacheFile exists it will resume the 
// download from cacheFile.
// while the file is downloading it will be name cacheFile.partial, after the 
// download is complete the file will be renamed to cacheFile.
// Example usage: ProxyFile(""http://media.railscasts.com/videos/176_searchlogic.mov"", 8000, @""c:\downloads\railscasts\176_searchlogic.mov"")
//
// Directly after this call http://localhost:8000 will be the proxy stream, it will be playable locally. 
void ProxyUri(Uri uri, int port, string cacheFile) 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong> </p>

<p><code>HttpListener</code> is looking pretty unpromising I will probably need to do the work at a TCP socket level as <code>HttpListener</code>s seem to require the program runs as admin which is going to be really tricky. </p>

<p>I've modified my code to something that looks like it makes sense to me.  The getVenueIntroText doesn't complain when I call it - I haven't got any items in the database btw.</p>

<p>When I call setVenueIntroText, it doesn't like what I'm doing for some reason - if someone knows the reason why, I'd really like to know :)</p>

<p>Here's my latest attempt:</p>

<pre><code>def getVenueIntroText():
  venue_info = """"
  venue_obj = db.GqlQuery(""SELECT * FROM Venue"").get()

  if venue_obj is not None:
      venue_info = venue_obj.intro_text

  return venue_info

def setVenueIntroText(text):
  venue_obj = db.GqlQuery(""SELECT * FROM Venue"").get()
  if venue_obj is None:
     venue_obj = Venue(intro_text = text)
  else:
     venue_obj.intro_text = text

  db.put(venue_obj)

<p>Now here's the deal. I have no personal intention of learning Ruby on Rails just yet, but it's the topic of a group presentation I am to do at the Uni (and my mates chose the RoR subject). People with a grudge against students asking homework-type questions should leave immediately.</p>

<p>This question is for RoR people who find it great. I hope to find those that claim RoR is the best (authors of the breathtaking testimonials to be found at RoR website). What makes RoR so outstanding? What would you like the youths of today to find out about it just before they leave the Uni with a degree. Try suggesting something that could root in their minds and perhaps navigate them the RoR way after leaving Uni.</p>

What is the largest positive n for which I can safely assume that p + n doesn't overflow when p is a char pointer into a constant character buffer or a dynamically allocated string (on a modern >= 32-bit operating system)?</p>

<p>To avoid confusion: I'm talking about <em>overflow checking, not about bounds checking</em>. For example: If you have a pointer p to the beginning of a string with m chars and you want to access the char at the positive offset i, then you either need to check that i &lt; m or you can check indirectly p + i &lt; p + m. However, in the latter case you also have to make sure that p + i doesn't overflow, i.e. you have to make sure that p + i >= p.</p>

<p>Update: Ok, p + i is not valid standard C if i > m, regardless of whether p + i is actually dereferenced or whether it overflows. However, the question I'm really interested in is whether there is a small n for which p + n won't overflow <em>in practice</em>. Answering this question obviously requires some knowledge about how modern operating systems organize the address space.</p>

<p>Update2: It would already be very interesting to hear about any one particular platform,  even if it's not generalizable. Preferably not some obscure embedded one. x86 or Power-based 32-bit Win, Linux and Mac would be most interesting.</p>

<p>Let's say there are 3 nodes in the treeview. 0) General; 1) Sounds; and 2) About; If I click node [1]Sounds, it will display the appropriate groupbox, but if I right click on treeview node [0]General, it will display it's frame and once I lift up the right click on the mouse, the focus will revert back to [1]Sounds but leave the groupbox for node 0) General.

<p>I am trying to implement more features for a class (Java TreeMap as an example). </p>

<pre><code>public class TreeMap&lt;K,V&gt; 
   extends AbstractMap&lt;K,V&gt;
   implements NavigableMap&lt;K,V&gt;, Cloneable, Serializable
</code></pre>

<p>Using composition is the <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=favour+composition+over+inheritance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">way to go on this</a>, so I would have to create first a
reusable forwarding class, which will wrap the functionality of the class, while
at the same time make it do only that so that It can be used elsewhere in the future.</p>

<pre><code>public class ForwardingNavigableMap&lt;K,V&gt; implements NavigableMap&lt;K,V&gt;
{
 ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would then proceed with creating a wrapper class which inherits the newly created
<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=ka2VUBqHiWkC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=reusable+forwarding+class&amp;hl=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reusable forwarding class</a>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>public class BetterTreeMap&lt;K,V&gt; extends ForwardingNavigableMap&lt;K,V&gt;
{
 /* some new cool features here */
}
</code></pre>

<p>What happens If TreeMap contains a number of fine features that I need in 
my class, that might not be as part of the NavigableMap interface? Should I then
proceed in declaring my own interface for TreeMap, and implement that in my reusable class? Any input here is appreciated.</p>

<p>In the header:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php include 'http://www.mydomain.com/tracker/tracker.php?xyz='.$_GET[xyz]; ?&gt;

<p>The first part basically sets the cookie while the second forwards a return url to Paypal so that when someone decides to buy, this gets returned to us. I've not made the second part hidden as I want to be able to check whether the affiliates have really added the code.</p>

<p>This all works fine in simple hand-written PHP but it all goes wrong when these affiliates are using databases. Their scripts will then probably echo something like $row['paypal'] which will literally show the inserted lines and not parse the $_GET. </p>

<p>I have absolutely no clue as to how this gets resolved. If possible I would like something that I could fix on my side as I don't want to annoy my affiliates with lots of customization on their side as they are mainly non-technical people.</p>

<li>Passing in the original code string for the filename to compile(). However, I lose the ability to actually keep a filename there, which I'd like to also do.</li>
<li>Keeping a real dictionary mapping code objects to strings. This leaks memory, although since compiling is rare, it's acceptable for my current use case. I could probably run the keys through gc.get_referrers periodically and kill off dead ones, if I had to.</li>

<p>There are 3 conceivable scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>All good data</strong> where all the data fits a single trend with a low variability</li></li>
<li><strong>All bad data</strong> where all or most of the data exhibits tremendous variability and the entire dataset must be discarded.</li></li>
<li><strong>Partial good data</strong> where some of the data may be good while the rest needs to be discarded.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the net percentage of data with extreme variability is too high then the entire set must be discarded. This implies that there is essentially only this type of data and the percentage of bad data varies:</p>
  
  <p>0% bad = Case 1<br>
  100% bad = Case 2</p>
  
  <p>I am only looking for contiguous sections with low variablity; i.e. I don't care if there are some individual points that fit the trend</li></blockquote></p>


<p>What I am looking for is a smart way to subsection section the dataset and search for the specified trend. As is the nature of the problem, I am not looking for sections that best fit the overall trend. I understand that the subsection with ""cleaner"" data will end up having slightly different trendline properties than the overall (which would contain the outliers). This is exactly what i want since this part of the data would best best reflect the actual trend.</p>

<p>I am fluent in C++ but, since I am trying to make the code open source and cross-platform, I am stick to ISO C++ standards. This implies no .NET but if you have a .NET example I would appreciate if you could also help me convert it to ISO C++. I also have knowledge of JAVA, some assembly and fortran.</p>

<p>The datasets themselves are not huge but there are about 150 million of them and so brute force may not be the best way.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<hr>

<p>I understand that I have left some things up in the air and so let me clarify:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each dataset can, and probably will, have different trends; i.e. I am not looking for the same trend throughout all datasets.</li>
<li>The program user will define how close a fit they want</li>
<li>The program user will define how contiguous the subset must be before it its considered for trend fitting</li>
<li>In case the program is extended to allow for any type of fit (not simply linear), the user will define what model is to be fit -- THIS IS NOT A PRIORITY and if the above query is solved then I am sure this expansion would be relatively trivial</li>
<li>The outliers come about as a result of the nature of the experiment and the data acquisition technique whereby data from ""bad"" sections must still be collected even though these areas are known to give outliers. The discarding of these outliers DOES NOT imply that the data is being manipulated to fit any trend (statistics disclaimer, hehe).</li>

<p>Typically these promotions will be HTML email messages with lots of pretty graphics and whatnot.  I don't expect my users to know much, if any, HTML at all (ideally they would have someone to create these promos, but I can't guarantee it as I'm targeting small businesses and organizations who might not have on-site IT staff).  My application would save these promotions and allow them to be modified.  To make it easier on the end user I am debating using a templating system of some kind, for example Textile, so they don't need to know HTML but can create nice looking promotions.</p>

<p>Now, this is basically what amounts to a CMS but not as encompassing or feature-rich.  Would I be better off to use a CMS of some sort and tweak it to suit my needs, or could I get away with writing my own since it's a less-functional CMS at it's heart?  My application is going to be written using Ruby on Rails, but I'm not really familiar with any good quality CMS systems for that framework (and a lot of Rails applications seem to dislike playing with other apps).  What I would have to do is save the template and then let the user select it later (along with the list of people they want to send it to), and tell ActionMailer to render the chosen template as the body of the message, while providing the first/last name of the customer(s) that will receive it.  This doesn't sound that difficult to create, but if I can save development time by using or modifying an existing solution I would prefer to go that route.</p>

WARN r Apache2::RequestRec=SCALAR(0x2ae0598e9ef0)
WARN headers APR::Table=HASH(0x2ae06cad15a0)
</code></pre>

<p>with execution appearing to halt as soon as any access to the APR::Table is attempted.
The tied interface for APR::Table had the same effect - i.e. changing the <code>get('Accept')</code> line to:</p>

<pre><code>my $accept = $headers-&gt;{Accept};
</code></pre>

<p>gives exactly the same log output.</p>

<p>According to the above linked documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This table is available starting from the PerlHeaderParserHandler phase</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I would expect my code, running in the PerlResponseHandler phase, to be able to access the headers.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas what I'm doing wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Using Data::Dumper hasn't really clarified matters at all.</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>use Data::Dumper;
$logger-&gt;warn(Dumper($r));
my $headers = $r-&gt;headers_in;
$logger-&gt;warn($headers);
$logger-&gt;warn(Dumper($headers));

WARN APR::Table=HASH(0x2ae071b06fd0)
</code></pre>

<p>So it seems that trying to get into $headers even through Data::Dumper results in the execution halting.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Attempting to set one of the headers fails as well.</p>

<pre><code>$logger-&gt;warn('reset accept');
$r-&gt;headers_in-&gt;{'Accept'}= 'everything';
$logger-&gt;warn('post set accept');
</code></pre>

<p>stops log output at the </p>

<ol>
<li>We tought the width could be fixed and around 1000px. Comments?</li>
<li>Should we specify the width using em to make the layout more scalable for different font widths?</li>
<li>Since the web site will be launched in about a year from now we skip support for IE6 and focus on IE7, IE8, Firefox 3.x+ and Safari (version to be decided). Comments?</li>
<li><strong>Suggestions on the markup and CSS for this?</strong></li>
<li>Which version of (X)HTML and CSS would you recommend? Why? </li>
<li>Do you think a version for devices with small screens could simply be based on a custom CSS or would it need differences in the layout markup?</li>

<p>Here are my questions:</p>

<p>Is object oriented the best way to represent a real world simulation domain?</p>

<p>I know that Common Lisp has CLOS (OO for lisp), but my question is really about writing a flight simulator in a functional language.  So if you were going to write it in Lisp, would you choose to use CLOS or write it in a functional manner?</p>

<p>Does anyone have any thoughts on coding a flight simulator in lisp or any functional language?</p>

<p>On my application I have many pages composed from many ""widgets"" (sort of) each having its own specific function.  </p>

<p>It seemed to me more reasonable to use the <code>RenderAction</code> method as each widget would have a dedicated controller responsible for getting different data and rendering a dedicated view (as opposed to having only one controller and a unique view model to pass to <code>RenderPartial</code> helper to render views). </p>

<p>From the tests I have done having a form that points to a Create action method in a controller like:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;% using (Html.BeginForm(""Create"", ""Message"", FormMethod.Post, 
     new { id = ""messageCreateForm"" })) {%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and calling it with </p>

<pre><code> &lt;% Html.RenderPartial(""MessageForm"",new MessageDTO()); %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>will render correcly a:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""messageCreateForm"" method=""post"" action=""/Message/Create""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but with the same equivalent with <code>RenderAction</code> (so using a <code>MessageForm</code> action method on the controller to render the view) would not render correcly so:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;% Html.RenderAction&lt;MessageController&gt;(m =&gt; m.MessageForm()); %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>will render in:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""messageCreateForm"" method=""post"" action=""""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the action is empty.</p>

<p>Is this the correct way to use the <code>RenderAction</code> helper and is it correct to use it in cases like that?</p>

Actually renaming the partial view to _MessageForm renders the form correcly.</p>

The trouble is that the current solution means you have to write some code to wrap the functionality. I came up with the following solution</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;typeparam name=""TKey""&gt;Class used for generating key into session state storage.&lt;/typeparam&gt;
/// &lt;typeparam name=""T""&gt;Type of object to store.&lt;/typeparam&gt;
public static class SessionManager&lt;TKey, T&gt;
{
    static SessionManager()
    {
        _key = typeof(TKey).ToString();
    }

    private static readonly string _key;
    public static string Key
    {
        get { return _key; }
    }

     // Other functions ... (Set, IsSet, Remove, etc.)

}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can create the desired storage by merely using</p>

<pre><code>using StringStore= Test.SessionManager&lt;System.Boolean, System.String&gt;;
using StringStore2= Test.SessionManager&lt;System.Version, System.String&gt;;

StringStore.Set(""I'm here"");
StringStore2.Set(""I'm also here"");
</code></pre>

<p>The code works and is nice in that you can easily create the wrapper class (single using statement) and everything is static. The code is however abusing the type system a bit, so maybe it is a bit to obscure? Before I added it I wanted to get some feedback, so here's the question:</p>

<li>Hunt down and kill whoever checked the file in?</li>

<p>I am not sure whether I should use database or not for the variable. However, I know that there is an easier way too to save the number of votes.</p>

<p><strong>How can you solve those problems?</strong></p>

<p>I have an application with two ScatterViews. The first covers the complete Surface window ('surface'). The second resides in a TagVisualization object ('pod'). There might be more than one pod available (if more than one tag is down on the table).</p>

<p>I would like to be able to drag a ScatterViewItem from the 'pod' to the 'surface' or another 'pod'. I have no problems in detecting if a ScatterViewItem is leaving its ScatterView parent. Also, no problems in reparenting the ScatterViewItem.</p>

<p>However, I want to detect which ScatterView the item is being dragged on. In the SDK Sample they have used a visual element (an ellipse in this case) which is below the ScatterViews. VisualTreeHelper.HitTest is used to determine if the contact is over the ellipse. If so, the 'connected' ScatterView is found.</p>

<p>I don't think this is a very elegant solution. I wouldn't want a visual element put in there, just to detect if a contact is over a ScatterView.</p>

<p>Are there betterwways to accomplish this kind of 'hittesting'?</p>

I'm trying to generalize it as much as I can so others can gain from it as well, but I don't really have anyone to give me feedback on this design, so I hoped you guys could help me.</p>

<p>With that being said, I wan't to model different usertypes in my database. I would like to have the credentials for the usertypes to be shared though. This problem is basically about inheritance, which is something that the RDB's doesn't do too well.</p>

<p>I did however come up with this design:
<a href=""http://img48.imageshack.us/img48/9196/dbdesign.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DB design http://img48.imageshack.us/img48/9196/dbdesign.png</a></p>

<p>.. but I'm unsure if I should be satisfied with it. What I don't like about it is the amount of business-contracts in it. First of all, I don't know which usertype belongs to a given credential, which means that I potentially have to search N tables, with N being the number of usertypes I got. Therefore, I thought of linking the type of a user with the roles he or she is in. So, if a user with credentials A has the roles of ""UserType1"" and ""UserType2"" I would expect to have a tuggle in the UserType1 and UserType2 tables representing him or her. - and I'm not sure if I like these ""business-logic""-constraints.. :)</p>

<p>Any feedback on this given design would be very much appreciated, just as any alternative designs would be.</p>

<p>This is what I want to do: Create partial classes to split up a code behind file.
Why am I not able to create partial classes directly?</p>

<p>If this is the codebehind file:</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Configuration....


public partial class _Default : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Test();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And also create this class:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class _Default
{
    public void Test()
    {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I get an error message, Test doesn't exists in current context.</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>

<p>I get everything to work if I create a couple of partial classes which inherits from System.Web.UI.Page and then inherit my codebehind file from this class (the result of the partial classes). Is this the only way?</p>

<p>Has is something to do with that the codebehind and the aspx-page is dynamically compiled into a class?</p>

<p>Would appreciate if anyone could answer my problem. Things are working out right now but I would prefer to create the partial classes at the same ""level"" as the codebehind and avoid to use inheritance.</p>

<p>On the one hand it seems like the easiest way would be to not represent folder objects and just store a path value for objects contained in a folder.  Problems I see with this is that you can't persist an folder whose descendants do not contain any items, which isn't too big of a deal.  Also I don't have a clear idea of how to load the folder hierarchy to display (such as in a TreeView) without loading everything into memory upfront, which would probably be a performance issue.</p>

<p>The alternative is to have a ""Folder"" table with references to its parent folder.  This seems like it should work, but I'm unsure how to allow folders with the same name as long as they do not share a parent.

<p>Features that are important to us:</p>

<ul>
<li>document sharing (specifications, manuals etc.)</li>
<li>discussion forums (I hate when important information is lost in the inbox)</li>
<li>issue tracking</li>
<li>Subversion integration would be nice to have but probably neither SharePoint, nor activeCollab currently support it, do they?</li>
</ul>

<p>Other things like time tracking are less important to us (although nice to have).</p>

<p>When I compare the two solutions, I see these strong points and drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Killer feature of SharePoint is Office integration. For instance, specification is much better authored in MS Word with styles, image drag&amp;drop etc. compared to a plain HTML textarea and some plain text format. We also use Outlook quite extensively so it would be good if we could leverage this tool.</li>
<li>activeCollab is web based and has a slick user interface which is important for adoption in our company (if our devs don't find the solution easy to work with, they will not use it). My boss also kind of likes easy solutions and activeCollab wins easily in this area.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding price, activeCollab is something like few hundreds dollars (reasonable one time cost) but I'm not too sure about SharePoint. If I'm right, the basic ""SharePoint Services"" version would be enough for us (I don't think we need the full MS Office SharePoint Server) and in that case, we need only Windows Server licence (which we already) and a SQL Server licence (would SQL Server Express work? or do we need at least workgroup edition?). This means that even SharePoint doesn't need to be too expensive if we go for the lowest edition.</p>

<p>Is there anyone who did the same comparison and could possibly provide more insight?</p>

<p>2) The last cell has what appears to be a UIView with the last updated time from the server. This UIView scrolls in sync with the table. Is it just an additional UITableViewCell styled differently from the rest of the cells and appended to the table?</p>

<p>I can't seem to find any tutorials or help file for setting up this class within a project, so I'm led to believe that it's not that difficult. Just causing me problems.</p>

I need the contents of the dropdowns to dynamically update when selections are made on other dropdowns. Hence, my need to catch the CBN_ events.</p>

<p>I've created a class that extends CFileDialog and a class that extends CComboBox. I can get the custom dialog (with the combos) to display but I cannot trap the CBN_ events.</p>

<p>I used the VS 'Create MFC DLL' wizard to get two classes: The app class and the custom file save dialog class. I created a derived CComboBox class so I could add messages/event trapping code. I put in the message maps, DoDataExchange and event trapping code in the dialog class. </p>

<p>The code that follows is an abridged version of what I'm working with. I figure I don't need to post the creation of three dropdowns when I can't get even one dropdown to work. I also didn't put in any code for the edit box, since I'm not having issues with that.</p>

<p>Some code: From the app class - creating an instance of the custom dialog, calling DoModal:</p>

CString cmdLineAsString =   CString( theApp.m_lpCmdLine );

int curPos  =   0 ;
CString fileExtension   = cmdLineAsString.Tokenize("" "", curPos ) ;
CString fileFilter  = cmdLineAsString.Tokenize("" "", curPos ) ; ;


MyFileDialog    dlg( FALSE, fileExtension.GetBuffer(), ""Enter File Name Here"",
                    OFN_HIDEREADONLY | OFN_OVERWRITEPROMPT,
                    fileFilter.GetBuffer(), m_pMainWnd) ;

<p>I've got a simple form:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= Html.ValidationSummary() %&gt;
&lt;% using(Html.BeginForm())%&gt;
&lt;%{ %&gt;
    &lt;%=Html.TextBox(""m.Value"") %&gt;
    &lt;input type=""submit"" /&gt;
&lt;%} %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When user submits I want to validate input and in some circumstances I want to fix the error for user, letting him know that he made an error that is already fixed:</p>

<pre><code>[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]
public ActionResult Index(M m)
{
    if (m.Value != ""a"")
    {
        ModelState.AddModelError(""m.Value"", ""should be \""a\"""");
        m.Value = ""a"";
        return View(m);
    }
    return View(""About"");            
}
</code></pre>

<p>Well the problem is, MVC will simply ignore the model passed to the view and will re-render whatever the user typed -- and not my value (""a"").
This happens, because the TextBox renderer checkes if there is a ModelState and if it's not null - ModelState's value is used. That value is of course the one user typed before posting.</p>

<p>Since I can't change the behaviour of TextBox renderer the only solution I found would be to update the ModelState by myself. The quick'n'dirty way is to (ab)use the DefaultModelBinder and override the method that assigns the values from forms to model by simply changing the assignment direction ;). Using DefaultModelBinder I don't have to parse the ids.
The following code (based on original implementation of DefaultModelBinder) is my solution to this:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Updates ModelState using values from &lt;paramref name=""order""/&gt;
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    /// &lt;param name=""order""&gt;Source&lt;/param&gt;
    /// &lt;param name=""prefix""&gt;Prefix used by Binder. Argument name in Action (if not explicitly specified).&lt;/param&gt;
    protected void UpdateModelState(object model, string prefix)
    {
        new ReversedBinder().BindModel(this.ControllerContext,
            new ModelBindingContext()
            {

<p>It doesn't feel correct as the delegate is aimed at application specific UI logic and controls should be a level above this. It would also mean I'd need to relay delegate calls out if an application class assigned itself as a delegate too which seems inefficient.</p>

<p>As a direct descendant of <em>UIScrollView</em> I'd expect to be able to override the method that triggers the <em>scrollViewDidScroll</em> delegate call, or be given access to a template method, or listen out for scroll events, but I can't see any such options.</p>

"719452","1","","","2009-04-05 18:41:42","","1","1972","<p>I am looking for a specific hashcode that has the following properties. I dont know of any such hashcodes and I dont know if it is possible to do such a thing. Just wanted to put it out there and see what people say.</p>

<p>I have two databases (loosely used term - dont think of SQL or anything of that sort), one master and one backup. There is a need to keep the two databases in sync and to detect when the databases are not in sync. Instead of verifying every data in there, it would be preferable to keep some hashcode that can be verified. But the two databases dont necessarily share every modifications. Since changes from master to backup are batched, it is possible that certain modifications from the master to backup are collapsed.</p>

<p>ie: lets say current state of database has elements A->X, B->Y and C->Z. Now B gets modified such that B->Y1 and then later B->Y2. The only change that will get sent from master to backup is B->Y2. The intermediate B->Y1 is skipped.</p>

<p>Now instead of looping over every element in each database to verify that they match, we would prefer to keep a running hash code of the elements in both the locations and then just compare that. The hashcode would have to compute something like:</p>

<p>assuming previous hashcode of hm0:<br>
hashcode hm1 = f(hm0, A->X, B->Y, C->Z)</p>

<p>When B changes now:<br>
hashcode hm2 = f(hm1, B->Y1)<br>
and then<br>
hashcode hm3 = f(hm2, B->Y2)</p>

<p>So master will have hashcode of h3. Now backup will not receive the modification B->Y2, so if it computes a running hash code, it will be like this:</p>

<p>hashcode hb1 = f(hb0, A->X, B->Y, C->Z)<br>
hashcode hb2 = f(hb1, B->Y2)</p>

<p>Now we want hb2 and hm3 to match, as the current state of the databases are the same. But most (if not all) hashcodes dont work this way. </p>

<p>So what we would want then is that we would want to ""remove"" the contribution of B->Y from the hash first and then 'add' the contribution of B->Y1 and then remove contribution of B->Y1 and add the contribution of B->Y2 into the hash code. So we want something like this:</p>

<p>Two functions, f, g: f modifies existing hashcode by adding contribution of a new element, while g modifies existing hashcode by removing contribution of an element.</p>

<p>On master:<br>
hm1 = f(hm0, A->X, B->Y, C->Z)</p>

<p>when B gets modified to B->Y1:<br>
hm2 = g(hm1, B->Y)<br>
hm3 = f(hm2, B->Y1)</p>

<p>when B get modified to B->Y2:<br>
hm4 = g(hm3, B->Y1)<br>
hm5 = f(hm4, B->Y2)</p>

<p>hm5 is the new hashcode for the current state of the database (A->X, B->Y2, C->Z)</p>

<p>On backup:<br>
hb1 = f(hb0, A->X, B->Y, C->Z)</p>

<p>when B gets modified to B->Y2:<br>
hb2 = g(hb1, B->Y)<br>
hb3 = f(hb2, B->Y2)</p>

<p>Now hm5 and hb3 should match, as the current state of both databases is the same.</p>

<p>So: are there such algorithms f and g? I hope I made the question clear....  Thanks.</p>

<p>I'm trying to create a tool which mimics the basic capabilities of a requirements management tool as part of a company project.</p>

<p>The basic design is a Windows Explorer-like setting of folders and documents. Documents can be opened in a GUI, editted, and saved.</p>

<p>The document itself contains a hierarchical spreadsheet (think of Excel with Chapters, if that makes any sense). Each chapter contains rows, which are really just some requirements text + some other values which complement it. When displayed, the requirement text and attribute values show up as independent columns (much like Excel), with filtering capabilities.</p>

<p>Representing the user/permissions/folder hierarchy/etc for this type of program is pretty straightforward, but where I get hung up on is the document content itself...</p>

<p>My biggest concern is size and how it relates to performance: As part of this tool, I not only intended to store the current state of each document, but also the entire list of changes that have been made since day 1 (much like SVN), and then provide fast access to the history of changes.</p>

<p>On average, I expect ~500 documents in the repo; Each document will probably have ~20,000 active rows; Over the course of a year, it's not unreasonable to assume ~20,000 edits (meaning each document itself will acquire an additional 20,000 rows year-in and year-out).</p>

<p>Multiplied by the number of documents, that amounts to nearly 10,000,000 rows (with an additional 10,000,000 the next year, and the next year, and so on). Old histories can be purged, but it would only be performed by an admin (and it's not preferable that he/she do so).</p>

<p>As I see it, there are two ways for me to handle this situation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I can try to represent a list all rows of all documents in a single table (much like how phpBB stores all posts of all forums in a single table), or...</p></li>
<li><p>I can try to store the rows of each document in a uniquely named table (meaning each document has it's own table); The table would have to be given a unique name, and a master table would contain the list of all documents and the table names that correspond to each.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So my question: Which really is preferable? Are neither really good options? Can anyone offer advice on which approach you would find more appropriate, given the needs?</p>

<p>I have and does anyone here care about pure methods? Methods with no side-effects? There's so many great things about C# that I love, but I can't write pure functions, that is, static methods with no side-effects.</p>

<p>What if you were to build your own C# compiler where you could write something like this.</p>

<pre><code>function int func(readonly SomeRefType a, int x, int y) { return /*...*/; }
</code></pre>

<p>Not only is the above a free function, alas, I don't call it a method, the function is assured to not have any side-effects. The C# keyword <code>readonly</code> could here be used to indicate just that, and provide a contract for pure functions. These kind of functions can always be evulated, without causing side effects. This being a way for Visual Studio to always evaulate my functions in the watch, despite the faulty assumpation that all method calls and user operators have side effects. A method where all the parameters are copy by value can never have side effects, yet, Visual Studio fails to recognize this.</p>

<p>I love C++ for what you can do at compile-time and I miss these things in C#, I think C# is dumbing down on the user a bit and basically not allowing certain expressiveness, hurting programmers. Many things which actually relate what you can do at compile time, I'd like to actually see more meta programs which are programs run by the compiler to compiler your original program.</p>

<p>e.g. While C# has booleans and don't allow things like <code>if (var a = obj as MyRefType)</code>, it doesn't generate the approriate code. I did some digging around and noticed how C# fails to generate approriate IL for branchless conditionals, for example <code>x &gt; y ? 1 : 0</code>, there's an IL instruction for just that which the C# compiler dosen't use.</p>

<p>Would you want, or be instrested in an open-source .NET compiler? Which looks like C# but is something entierly different, more expressive, and more flexible, and totally whaack, in terms what you can do with it?</p>

<p>In short, the 2 loops loop through same array of strings and choose only unique strings -> it means that the string can't be a prefix to any other string.</p>

<p>I used <a href=""http://docs.python.org/dev/3.0/library/zipfile.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this site</a> to figure out how to use <code>zipfile</code>.  <code>zipfile</code> is a class, I import it at the start of the program then I use it and its primary method.

Then the command writes the file to the destination folder with a sub-method like so, <code>"""".zipfile('files to write')</code>.</p>

<p>I have a whole list of these statements going up to 125 mph and for different years: 1 through 4. I'm trying to make a program that takes input for speed of a vehicle, then gives appropriate ticket information according to speed.</p>

<p>The speed limit is 15 mph. For every 5 miles per hour over speed limit, $87.50 is added towards the total. Year 2 is sophomore so a $50.00 discount applies. Yet for like year 4, a $100.00 fee is added towards the total. I am getting same total for each speed. Why?  </p>

<p>Update:
For my situation, the original set has lots of items but after the where clause the result set is very small.  Enumerating over the second set several times should not be a problem.  Also I need to use first and last on the set to get a value from those records.  The group by answer will work best for me.  The aggregate way is very interesting and I think have another use for that.</p>

Everything I have read has indicated that JIT'ed assemblies (i.e., not using NGen to create native images) result in all code space being stored in private pages, increasing working set size / memory pressure.  However, actual results (verified using Process Explorer, VMMap, and WinDbg) show that even the JIT'ed assemblies are indeed being placed in shareable pages (and are indeed being shared when there are multiple instances of the app running, even under separate TS sessions/users).</p>

<p>Can anyone explain why this might be?  This is running in a W2K8 Server environment, so ASLR explains why a lack of specific base addresses for each assembly &amp; the resulting rebasing isn't causing problems.  Still, it seems the fact these aren't native PE images should result in the code for those assemblies being stored in private pages.</p>

<p>This was discovered when we started investigating using NGen to cut down on memory pressure, but actually found it increased working set size - since the JIT'ed assemblies were already being shared.</p>

<p>The most recent reference I've found is here, which again differs from our actual findings:</p>

<p><a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/morgan/archive/2009/03/07/developing-net-applications-for-deployment-on-terminal-services-or-citrix.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://blogs.msdn.com/morgan/archive/2009/03/07/developing-net-applications-for-deployment-on-terminal-services-or-citrix.aspx</a></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I should add that since first posting the question, more experiments on Windows Server 2003 test boxes are also apparently showing the JIT'ed assemblies being sharable between processes.  I'm still stumped as to why all advice I can find indicates NGen is required, but all the real-world evidence contradicts that.  I'm really hoping the experts here can shed some light.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I've dusted off all my .NET / CLR books and am running out of ideas for search queries to try to solve this one; who's going to make my day by helping eliminate that awful nagging feeling of ""I don't understand what's going on""!?! :)</p>

I am using a DDD approach and have domain objects for everything.  A typical scenario is something like a User object with a user edit and entry page.  </p>

<p>After working on this for a few types of objects, I am seeing a pattern.  I am creating a view that does nothing but binds to the domain object.  Each view has a similar look with a header (bound to the domain object), and some edit controls based on the data type of the view (check box for bool, lots of text boxes, etc).  </p>

<p>So I'm thinking, instead of creating a separate view for each class, I could create some sort of generic View class that auto generates a form based on the object in the DataContext.  I could somehow tell the View what order to place the fields (i.e. First/Last name is on top, then phone, then address, etc...), and also give some attributes to the fields (such as setting First/Last name as a header which will be shown in bold or something).  To me, this sounds similar to what you do with CSS.  Then to change the look of the entire application, I just have to change the View or the template for the View.  </p>

<p>So here are my questions:</p>

<p>Does this approach make sense and would it work?</p>

<p>Is there anything like this already?</p>

2. EDIT:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The spec makes no guarantee which cookies a browser must keep when it runs out of storage, so browsers are free to behave how they like, and you should expect different behaviours.

HTTP headers are not ordered, so there's no guarantee they will be processed in any particular order in the first place.</p>

<p>Off the top of my head:</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of Self-hosting</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Flexibility. On my own machine I can install whatever I want. If I would like to use a vcs like Bazaar and use Loggerhead instead of Trac, then right now there isn't really much choice beyond Launchpad, which has its warts  </li>
<li>Save money. Costs add up over time especially for large teams</li>
<li>The free plans offered by sites like Assembla are not private. Anybody can have access to your code</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advantages of Paid hosting (ie: GitHub, Assembla, Google Code)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Robustness. You don't need to worry about your server catching fire because it's become somebody else's problem.</li>
<li>Less hassle. Don't need to be do all the system administration and tweaking of conf files. Instead you can just focus on the coding</li>

<p>I have a strange two-sided coin that only comes up heads (randomly) 1 in every 1,001 tosses (the remainder being tails).  In other words, for every 1,000 tails I see, there will be 1 heads.</p>

<p>I have a peculiar disease where I only notice 1 in every 1,000 tails I see, but I notice every heads, and so it appears to me that the rate of noticing a heads or tails is 0.5.  Of course, I'm aware of this disease and its effect so I can compensate for it.</p>

<p>Someone now gives me a new coin, and I noticed that the rate of noticing heads is now 0.6.  Given that my disease hasn't changed (I still only notice 1 in every 1,000 tails), how do I calculate the actual ratio of heads to tails that this new coin produces?</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok, so what is the real problem?  Well, I have a bunch of data consisting of input, and outputs which are 1s and 0s.  I want to teach a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict the expected output (a float between 0 and 1) given an input.  The problem is that the 1s are very rare, and this screws up the internal math because it becomes very susceptible to rounding errors - even with high-precision floating point math.</p>

<p>So, I normalize the data by randomly omitting most of the 0 training samples so that it appears that there is a roughly equal ratio of 1s and 0s.  Of course, this means that now the machine learning algorithm's output is no-longer predicting a probability, ie. instead of predicting 0.001 as it should, it would now predict 0.5.</p>

<p>I need a way to convert the output of the machine learning algorithm back to a probability within the original training set.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633506(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">GetGUIThreadInfo</a> API looks promising -- it returns an <code>hwndFocus</code> for another app. But I've had no luck getting it to work from C# on my 64-bit OS. I've copied (and then further tweaked) the declarations from <a href=""http://pinvoke.net"" rel=""noreferrer"">pinvoke.net</a>, but all I ever get back is a generic error code (more details below).</p>

<p>I am setting cbSize before I call GetGUIThreadInfo, so I've avoided the most obvious potential problem.</p>

<p>I'm running 64-bit Vista, so I don't know whether the problem is that I'm not using the API correctly, or that it works differently in 64-bit -- I have yet to find a code sample that specifically says it works successfully in Win64.</p>

<p>Here's sample code. I'm using GetWindowThreadProcessId <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633506(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">as recommended</a>, so I don't think the problem has to do with mixing thread IDs with thread handles:</p>

<ol>
<li>HTML is for content</li>
<li>CSS is for presentation</li>
<li>JavaScript is for behavior.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is normally all fine and good, and I find that when I strictly follow these guidelines and use external <code>.css</code> and <code>.js</code> files, it makes my entire site much much more manageable. However, I think I found a situation that breaks this line of thought.</p>

<p>I have a custom forums system that I've built for one of my sites. In addition to the usual formatting for such a system (links, images, bold italics and underline, etc) I've allowed my users to set the formatting of their text, including color, font family, and size. All of this is saved in by database of forum messages as formatting code, and then translated to the corresponding HTML when the page is viewed. (A bit inefficient, technically I should translate before saving, but this way I can work on the system live.)</p>

<p>Due to the nature of this and other similar systems, I end up with a lot of  tags floating around the resulting HTML code, which I believe are unofficially deprecated since I'm supposed to be using CSS for formatting. This breaks rules one and two, which state that HTML should not contain formatting information, preferring that information to be located in the CSS document instead.</p>

<p>Is there a way to achieve dynamic formatting in CSS without including that information in the markup? Is it worth the trouble? Or, considering the implied limitations of proper code, an I to <em>limit what my users can do</em> in order to follow the ""correct"" way to format my code?</p>

<p>Am I missing something, or is there no way to do this?</p>

<hr/>

<p>It was in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B#32-bit_versions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Visual C++</a> 6. I think it was menu <em>Tools</em> -> <em>Options</em> -> <em>Directories</em> -> executable files.</p>

<p>Perhaps now this was not what I thought it was - this may be the same as what I have found in Visual&nbsp;Studio&nbsp;2008.</p>

<p>Basically I am looking for a way to ""append"" to the PATH environment variable - just for running the EXE file project open in Visual Studio (without actually editing the path environment variable).</p>

<p>The workaround is for me to copy all the dependencies to the working directory. That will work - it just involves some changes to other projects - and gathering third-party stuff (this was a huge migration from Visual C++ 6).</p>

User Interface (web page)
BLL (Manager &amp; Domain Objects)
DAL (DataAccess class for each of my Domain Objects).</p>

<p>I use the following in the UI to search for a domain object.</p>

<pre><code>protect sub Button1_Click()
{
    IBook book = BookManager.GetBook(txtID.Text);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my BLL</p>

<pre><code>public class BookManager 
{
    public static IBook GetBook(string bookId)
    {
        return BookDB.GetBook(bookId);
    }
}

public class Book : IBook
{

    private string _name;
    private string _genre;

    public string Name
    {

        {
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(value))
                throw new Exception(""Invalid Name"");
            _name = value;
        }
    }

    public string Genre

            _genre = value;
        }
    }

    // Other IBook Implementations

}
</code></pre>

<p>And finally here is my DAL</p>

<pre><code>public class BookDB
{
    public static IBook GetBook(int id)
    {
        // Get Book from database using sproc (not allowed to use any ORM)
        // ?? Create IBook Item?
        // return IBook
    }
</code></pre>

<p>How would one create a IBook Object and return it to the Manager?
I'm thinking of returning a DataTable from BookDB to BookManager and having it create the Book Object and return it, but that doesn't seem right.
Is there another way to do this?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:
I decided to seperate each layer into a project and ran into a circular dependency problem in the DAL layer when trying to add a reference to the BLL.
I can't access the Book Class or Interface or anything in BLL from DAL.
Should i just use ado.net objects here and have my manager create the actual object from the ado.net object?
Here's how its layed out</strong></p>

<pre><code>BLL.Managers - BookManager
BLL.Interfaces IBook
BLL.Domain - Book
DAL - BookDB.

Ok, so here I am 5 years later. I would like to point out that experience has told me, we should not put any configuration that intentionally is editable at runtime in the web.config file but instead we should put it in a separate XML file as what one of the users commented below. This will not require any of edit of web.config file to restart the App which will result with angry users calling you.</p>
